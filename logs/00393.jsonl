{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Anyway I-- The point is, I don't...blame you anymore. You're clearly not the same and I don't...think anyone in Kawasaki the way it is should really...be held accountable for things done while there.","d":"Aug 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Work... other work... bars and contact lists full of phone numbers...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":"<span style=\"color:#B269AE;\"> ...yeah, that's it</span>","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": For me it was, get super into the game and erasures or be obliterated by someone else-- I mean, you.","d":"Aug 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Right, I guess I kind of hunted you down while you were a Player and as a Reaper, huh...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Only for a while, you backed off eventually. I think you were just residual mad they offered to make me a Reaper.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Maybe...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": ...After that, though, I started like...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": ...questioning myself.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Like, \"Jesus, what the fuck are you doing\" sorta thing.","d":"Aug 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": It's weird to think I made you question anything. I was a punk. Probably deserved to be erased, honestly.","d":"Aug 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": ...Yeah.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": That's... essentially what it is.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Sorting through souls and deciding, this person can do more with their life.","d":"Aug 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": There's a lot you can do as a Reaper, you know.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":"<span style=\"color:#F0A91A;\"> shifts in his seat.</span>","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Such as? I mean, working at Riverbend during the week was cool. Helping the Players out from the side and all. But.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": If you can get a Player to want to come to life again, that's already a lot.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Even if they don't make it.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":"<span style=\"color:#F0A91A;\"> smiles a little.</span>","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": That is supposed to be the goal, yeah? I mean besides erasure, that's... Kinda the other side of that right? Coming down on the ones who won't fight for it?","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Yeah...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Hah, that's basically what Marseille is all about.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": But... yeah. I'm glad you don't... blame me anymore.","d":"Aug 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Don't.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": That's why I'm just. Determined to make Shibuya what you need to get better too.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Well... I haven't been here that long but I'd say you're doing a pretty good job.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": It's...I mean instantly recognizable, when you see how all the Reapers are and like...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":"<span style=\"color:#F0A91A;\"> laughs, shaking his head.</span>","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Experiencing the week, even though I wasn't playing exactly it was... It was incredible. A completely different vibe from how Kawasaki games are.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Also glad that this past week wasn't as traumatizing as the last two--","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Yeah... I was worried after I heard what happened last time... But... It turned out okay. One of the players kind of imprinted on me actually, I've been kinda wondering how she's doing but I haven't seen her.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Which one?","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Chiyo! She bought like. 20 soups from me throughout the week. Just kept coming back. I actually let her sleep in the cafe for a while.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Aw, aha... I think she's getting some medical stuff sorted out.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": We were able to cure her cancer so she could come back to life without worries about that.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":"<span style=\"color:#F0A91A;\"> grins. He hadn't actually heard.</span>","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": That's incredible... I meant to ask what happened... I knew she made it out but like I said I hadn't seen her.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Aha... I like keeping tabs on Players that make it out, too.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":"<span style=\"color:#F0A91A;\"> looks mildly uncomfortable.</span>","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": I...never really have before. In Kawasaki I never really...thought about them much.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": There... weren't really ever winners in the first place.","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": Yeah I don't...really get games in Kawasaki like... Was there ever a point? Why has it gone on like that for so long?","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": It's because Kawasaki's such a big district, really...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": It couldn't reincarnate too many people, hence the winner cap of 4 per game...","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": But there's nothing wrong with having no winners either, and a lot of the winners want to become Reapers because they're not the same after that game too--","d":"Aug 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F0A91A","n":"Shiori","m":": ...Yeah, but... Setting the Reapers off on the Players that way isn't right. And the way the Reapers interact with eachother is sick. Like, I wasn't <i>\u200bokay</i>\u200b after playing by any means. I didn't want to be a Reaper, I don't even think I wanted to be alive for a while there. But, I still wasn't... I wasn't like the others who became Reapers that week. I didn't want to jump into fighting or forming alliances or getting involved in everything I just. Wanted to go back. Truth be told, I still dream about it sometimes; being allowed to play again and doing better and making it out. Seeing my mom, telling everyone I'm okay and I'm going to do better. But the way Kawasaki's game is, I don't...think I could have ever made it out, you know? I don't think that was ever an option for me. Someone will always be better, someone will always do better. And if the Players weren't enough competition, a starving Reaper is always going to be around the corner to end your existence then and there. You have to be a certain caliber to make it out of Kawasaki alive and I wasn't.","d":"Aug 2016"}
