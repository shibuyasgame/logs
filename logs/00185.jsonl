{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Your turn!","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Uh, a load of stuff feels really vague for some reason, but it doesn't matter all that much, never did anything special. I live in Yokohama and played on my school's baseball team, we did pretty well in our league and I had to miss a lot of school goin' to matches and training. I never really focused on school, I had better things to be doing. Long story short, my grades sucked super bad so my parents booted me over to my aunt's place in to study for entrance exams when they were on holiday. Can't think of anything else noteweorthy.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Heh, I sound so boring in comparison to you.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": A boring story is good!","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": At least you weren't raised as a man to be the best...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Batter? In the world.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Guess so.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Should probably count my blessings.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Hotaru...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": What're you going to do if... no.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": When we win?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Ah, I'll probably end up going home and my parents'll be angry at me for worrying them or something like that. It'll probably be a real cheese-fest.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": You?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": I'm going to lie down in a sunflower field.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": And sleep for twelve hours.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Maybe even twenty four.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": I'm going to become a sunf- no, that is too much.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Close to one, at least.","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": What is your favorite flower, Hotaru?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Sunflower seeds...  they're my favorite snack.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": I searched every shop for them, but no luck.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Uh flowers aren't something I'm too interested in but those big daisies I guess? Ox-Eyes or whatever they're called.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Damn you healthy food and your lack of availability..","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": They're more gentle than their name implies.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": If they had sunflower seeds...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Maybe I wouldn't have dived into ramen hell.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Maybe.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": I dunno, ramen is more filling than seeds any day.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Thirty packs of Ramen?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Especially thirty packs of ramen.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": What is your favorite snack, Hotaru?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": I hope the answer is /nine ice creams/.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": It isn't nine ice creams, it's something much more dastardly than that.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Wh- more dastardly than nine ice creams?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Don't tell me... thirty ramen?!","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": I really, really like crepes, I'd eat fifty of them in one sitting, and I often eat them with ice cream as a topping, that'd probably constitute as een more than nine ice creams.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": ...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Crepes, huh.","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": That... is refined.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": How about this:","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": We make it out of this alive, we'll use our budget to buy you fifty.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": I seriously want to see you eat fifty crepes.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": It's a deal.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": We'll buy them legitimately, though.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Hopefully you can find some seeds to munch on too","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": Being the mob boss of the ramen black market is sort of...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Hana","m":": You know?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Hotaru","m":": Yeah. I get you.","d":"Feb 2015"}
