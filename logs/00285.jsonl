{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Huh. What's the Game like in Kyoto?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": It's, uh... it's a little hectic. For the Players.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": You gotta keep on your toes.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": How so? Hectic, I mean.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": ...You don't wanna get caught by a Reaper in Kyoto.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": ... but then how do the Players get stronger?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": Well... we still can't attack Players directly, until late in the Game.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": What I mean is...","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": ...Well, you gotta keep your wits about you.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": What do reapers do early on?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": Set traps.","d":"Nov 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":"<span style=\"color:#A8A8A8;\"> nods.</span>","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": Why's that?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": If you don't mind me asking.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": 'Cause it wasn't about demons so it wouldn't help me work better an' as such I didn't need to know it.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": ...Demons.","d":"Nov 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": So when'd you become a Reaper? Sounds like you haven't been one for too long.","d":"Nov 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": Oh, that soon?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": I heard there was a pretty, uh... messy Game recently.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":"<span style=\"color:#A8A8A8;\"> nods. \"Yep. I won it.\"</span>","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": Oh, nice.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Did you want to know anything about it?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": I'm a little curious, I admit.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Okay! ... Uhhh. What did you want to know?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": All I know is there's something about static and monsters and you guys lost a few Reapers.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": ...Not very descriptive.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":"<span style=\"color:#A8A8A8;\"> nods. Deep breath.</span>","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Our Game Master was Grizz. His story came out over the course of the Week.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": His story, huh? Do tell.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": He was initially a man called Seki, who got infected by static because of his first Composer or something, and the static possessed him and erased his memory.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": ...Ouch.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": The static was a hivemind demon. Part of it fragmented off to become Grizz.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Grizz didn't remember anything before he woke up as mostly static one day-- his body was all made of static 'cept his lower face.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": So he was in Shibuya an' established himself enough to become Game Master.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": But then some guy, Gen I think, came looking for Seki, and managed to connect Seki to Grizz. He tried to call out Seki by talking through Grizz, but only managed to weaken Grizz's ability to maintain control over the body.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Static took over at that point, changing his form to that of the demon.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Another reaper, Kyoka, was in love with Seki, an' had been chasing him since they died.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": She's the one who gave all this exposition.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": So anyway, Seki took control over the body, but didn't know where he was or what was going on. He recognised Kyoka only.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Me and April were pretty much Grizz's adopted daughters. So April ran up to Seki while he was talking to Kyoka, an' tried to talk through Seki to bring Grizz back out.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Kyoka was talking to Seki and acting as a focus for that personality. April was doing the same for Grizz.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": It made the two personalities unstable enough that they both lost control and Static took over again.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": The next time Seki appeared, he was begging Kyoka not to come near him, but she didn't listen and did it anyway. Static forcibly took control and killed Kyoka when she got too close. Kei and Jean couldn't do anything to stop it. I didn't see that part, but extrapolated from what I heard an' saw later.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Grizz appeared next. He was looking for the bracelet April had given him, that Seki lost. April saw him and ran to him, despite him begging her to stay away.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": ... Really, I dunno why nobody just grabbed her and flew away. There was totally time. Instead, everyone was just yelling at her to get back, even though they were lots stronger than she was an' could easily have just grabbed her an' run while Grizz was still in control. I couldn't, 'cause Rei was holding me too tight, but the others were just standing there, and I still don't know why. There was a period of time where April wasn't even touching him and Grizz was still in control.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": But anyway, nobody did, and she didn't understand not to approach the demon-possessed guy, so Static took control and murdered her. Her soul was locked in a pin. Now she's a kitten. Her partner died without ever knowing what hit him.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": This was later revealed to be all part of Static's plan. They let Seki and Grizz have control, knowing they were stronger than either host, and waited until the people they loved most approached them. The people who were capable of calling either of them out.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Then they forced their way into control and brutally murdered those loved ones, crushing Seki and Grizz's wills and allowing Static to have complete control.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Seki had no other focus but Kyoka, so he was gone completely, but Grizz was still in there somewhere.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Static said he relinquished control completely in order to make sure they didn't hurt me. I still dunno if they were lying, but they sure couldn't hurt me too much.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": This all culminated into Static being a giant static bison on the seventh day and sweeping the six of us remaining Players into the plane to fight them.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": All of the reapers joined in to help.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": They tried psychological warfare an' it was pretty clear Grizz was in there somewhere still, but...","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":"<span style=\"color:#A8A8A8;\"> shrugs.</span>","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Grizz was too weak and broken. Seki was dead.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": We beat down Static and it took the remnants of the host with it.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Once we thought the victory was complete, we left to the UG, and Static... reformed.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Kuroko tore off his mask and had feathery wings and a glowing sword and stabbed Static until they died for good.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": The other reaper we lost was Kazuya, who wanted to be erased 'cause he hated being a reaper an' erasing people so much. Kei got mad at him and said he wouldn't erase a reaper who'd done his job, so now Kazuya's gonna replay the Game, but can never be a reaper again.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": ... You're the first person who's actually listened to me explain any of this, so thanks, I guess.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": ...Wow.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": That was a story, alright.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Akio","m":": Informative, good attention to detail. I give you an A+.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":"<span style=\"color:#A8A8A8;\"> smiles a bit bashfully. \"Thank you.\"</span>","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": I think the officers an' stuff are still recovering now. There's a lot of paperwork and most of them exhausted themselves all week running after Static. So that's why they haven't been around.","d":"Nov 2015"}
