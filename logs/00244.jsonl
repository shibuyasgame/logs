{"t":"div","m":"<p>Back at home, I'd do nothing but study because of my two business addicted parents. I wasn't allowed much freedom to speak with others and as a result I didn't have many friends. My grades were passable for the hard work I did, and I was noticed by my teachers, but even then it was expected of me. I was the one guy that sits in your class that you know exists, but that's it. I simply existed and you knew my name. No one asked me to join them for anything, my attempts to make friends ended in failure, my parents never acknowledged my accomplishments, and life was depressing. I was used as their business tool up until recently.</p><p>I met the two reapers Malcolm and Nora while hanging out at the arcade for a short while. We played games and inevitably became friends. I'd wager it was because I decided not to be myself for once and air guitar in them and pretend to be a cool guy. Eventually we made our way to Nora's shop and I began visiting everyday. I finally made friends and I felt alive. It was pretty sweet. I started to pursue what I wanted to for a long time, which was play the guitar. To me it was like a boy's rite of passage into becoming a true, living being. My life was passing me up and college was drawing near, so I had to do something to make my life memorable. I had to get everyone to notice me. I hung out with everyone and played guitar to support Nora's shop until one day at the park I was hit by a car..... The car wasn't what killed me.</p><p>I was in critical condition for a few days and once I woke up....</p>"}
