So Peter and Nick ended up talking and it was like \"you dumb piece of shit, the Devils never cared about your stupid Lady. they did this for you! You saved them, and they want to repay that, it was never about the Lady for them. It was about you. You have to take responsibility.

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hmm....I don't believe we've met?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> who the fuck is nanami</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> vaguely remembers the name. Clingy reaper.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Don't believe we have, either! I just arrived in town a couple of days ago.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Name's Daisuke, though!","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> smiles!</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Ahhhh. Then yeah, we haven't met. I've been laying low to avid a person or two. My name's Orion. Active transfer reaper.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> smiles back</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> pulls a book out of his trenchcoat and begins writing</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Ah. A transfer, huh?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": I'm just... exploring districts, you could say.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yup. From Odaiba. Wanted to see some action. Heard Shibuya generally had a lot.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> laughs.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": I was told the same.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": ANd already it's been living up to its reputation.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Ohhh? How so? Does this have to do with you \"laying low?\"","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> tilts his head.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I made friends with a giant snake, met a very clingy, perverted reaper, and threw god at the conductor.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I've been laying low due to some bad feelings i've been having, but also because of the pervert reaper.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> blinks</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Oh my.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yup. Lot's of fun.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": If that's what it's like, then I should stick around for a while, huh?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": You'll certainly see something interesting at some point if you stick around.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I've been seeing lots of transfers and district-jumpers recently....guess Shibuya really is a hotspot, huh?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Mmmm, so it seems! It's got a reputation, so it's understandable, I guess.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Lot's of colorful people, that's for sure.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> stretches a bit</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Sooo then, what role do you usually take? Support or Active?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> switches his facial expression to one of confusion.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": There are different roles?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hmm?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": You ARE a reaper, yes?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Yeah, it's just--","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Huh. I didn't know there were districts with only one role.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Mmm. We all have to do the same thing, so there's no need for distinction, really.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> shrugs</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Well, in a number of districts, there's two main categories of reapers. Active and support.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> listens.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Active reapers actively attack the players. I personally see it as strengthening them. Others enjoy it as sport.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": If they don't erase a player by the end of a game week, they get erased instead.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Supports man walls and assist with battles and such, rather than directly interfereing with players.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Though they can still fight just like any other reaper.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> O:</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Ohhh. How interesting!","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So then, what district did you originally come from?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> huuums in thought, knowing exactly which role he'd be.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> --</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": I'm from the Chuo district of Sapporo.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hmmm....","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> writes down this info about the one-role district</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I like to keep track of info on other districts. I'm technically here as a transfer, but I can pretty much go anywhere within reason.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Odaiba is glad to have me anywhere but there, hmhmhm.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> tilts his head.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Did something happen with you in Odaiba?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": My normal noise form is a little....hostile. Hostile so much that it is sometimes beyond my control.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Huh. What is it?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I have a bad habit of ripping the players there to pieces when angered in noise form. Odaiba isn't exactly to forgiving for wild rage.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": A kraken.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> o h</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> snorts.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": I can... see how that could be a little hostile.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yup. Eventually, it culminated in me EATING a player, then crawling out of the noise plane in Kraken form.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The composer....was not amused.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> blinks.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": You ate someone?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Dude.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": My noise form is 20 feet tall. It can pretty much swallow people whole.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I heavily regret that day. I don't like actively horrifying players like that.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I enjoy intimidation. Not straight up, unparalleled fear.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Anyways, the composer decided that allowing me to be in that form outside the noise plane was a hazard....and decided to have a little fun.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> -??</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Fun?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They ripped off my noise form's tentacles, forced me into a new noise form while outside., and pretty much kept me as a pet for a week.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> shudders and cringes</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": ... I see what you mean about unforgiving.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Geez, that sounds... rough.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": I'm sorry that happened.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Indeed. Ever since then, I turn into that new noise form while outside of the noise plane out of instinct.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It's....well, it's an octopus. A small octopus less than a foot tall.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Oh? That sounds adorable.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> Unfortun</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The majority agrees with you.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I personally don't mind it, but it's somewhat embarassing to be reminded of my mistake whenever i transform.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> Unfortunate, yet adorable * WOW MY COMPUTER FREAKED OUT</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> happens to the best of us</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": I'd imagine.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> frowns.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> sighs</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Anyways, enough about me. What's your noise form like?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Ah, well, it's far less exciting than yours, that's for sure.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": It's just a regular ol' red fox.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hmmm. Useful in it's own right. My size usually makes me slow. You have speed o your side.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": At least you've got power on your side to make up for it, ne?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I suppose. Slow and strong means one hit hurts hard, but those hits are difficult to land.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": In comparison, a quick fox could slice me to ribbons before i even throw my first fist.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": --We should put that to the test sometime!","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": All noise forms fit their users, even if they don't realize it. I became a Kraken to be intimidating, but slow enough that a player can man up and retaliate.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> laughs.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> chuckles</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> is joking.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Mmmm... not sure about why fox fits me, but it is fairly nice.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Anyways, I think that's a fine noise form. I've seen quite a few simple ones. A bunny, a ferret, and even a simple cat. And all of them can hold their own really well.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Foxes are usually sly, as well as whimsical, but I can't say much from first impressions.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Whimsical, huh...","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> thinks about that, rather than the sly part. :')</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So...what's Chuo like? I've never heard of a district with one role before. It interests me to see how the reapers work there.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Mmm... Let's see.... How do I explain Sa-chuo...","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Well, you mentioned that you like to intimidate and strengthen Players, right?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": That's kinda the whole basis of what we do over there.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Ah. Sounds like a decnt place.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Decent, even.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> laughs.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": We go about it in a pretty harsh manner, but the end goal is pretty noble, yeah.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I am not one of those people to criticize the finer details. So long as the job gets done, the methods are irrelevant.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The job, in my eyes, being the strengthening of the worthy, and the elimination of the weak links.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Odaiba had a bad habit of letting the weak links of scotch free.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> agrees!</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> about the job thing.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Mmm, right.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Say, you could always check into visiting Sa-chuo for a Game! It sounds like your kind of place.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Perhaps. I want to finish one game here before I transfer again, but i'll certainly keep Sa-chuo in mind.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> nods.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Understandable.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": I can put in a good word for ya, if you end up checking it out.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> nods \"Much obliged!\"</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Odaiba's games....generally favor a low erasure rate due to being a smaller area","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": All reapers are paired together with other reapers. So long as one does their job, they both get to remain after the week.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": This means that if an active is paired with a support, that's one less pair of players that has to be erased.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": How interesting.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": It sounds... a little too nice, almost.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I personally agree.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": In Sa-chuo, Reapers get to pair up, too, but each one's still gotta get their erasure in-","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I have no problems with supporting and encouraging players. It keeps them motivated.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But when you let the weak continue being weak, it's an atrocious wrongdoing to the truly strong and worthy.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Right. When it comes down to it, the weak won't survive.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": ....Sorry about all my ranting. I just hate seeing garbage litter the streets. In more ways than one.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> o3o I like this one.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> waves a hand dismissively</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": No, no! It's fine.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Rant to me all you'd like. Sometimes it's nice to have someone to listen to it, ne?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yeah. But you never know. Many reapers in Odaiba tend to avoid me because of my harsher beliefs.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I truly do respect the players as a whole....but it saddens me to see great talent have to share the spotlight with those that manipulate feelings to get where they are.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Physical might, mental prowess, spiritual will, and emotional stability. These are the 4 types of strengths I look for in players and try to encourage.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Copassion is not one of those 4 things. People in this world take advantage of naive compassion.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> i hate my keyboard. So much.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> laughs a bit because Orion sounds a lot like a few people he knows back in Sapporo.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Those strengths are very important, I agree.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Mmmm, I'd say compassion isn't always a bad thing, though.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So long as they have those, they can survive the risks of compassion.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Physical strength to retaliate against betrayal of the feelings. Mental to know the limits of how compassionate one should be.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Emotional strength to keep strong in the face of broken bonds, and willpower to push forward.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Compassion weakens a person, but the strong can overcome that wekaness, and turn it into strength.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":": Wise words.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"851919","n":"Daisuke","m":"<span style=\"color:#851919;\"> smiles softly</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": ....the problem is, I lose control of those beliefs if my noise form is angered....","d":"Dec 2015"}

It was his dream to one day grab that very instrument you have before you and leave his imprint on the world. Although he is no longer here, he has left behind his legacy for you, his chosen successor, to reap the future. No longer will the trope of a boy's rite of passage be carried out through this guitar. From now it is the girl's turn to shine bright like a star.  Until that time comes where you meet face-to-face, shred your tears and flick your wrists in happiness.  I will always believe in you. --Happy Belated Birthday and Merry Christmas. </i>\u200b    <b>\u200b  - Yoshida Corp.</b></span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
