It was written by Jamille Pierre, Badrilla Bourelly, Rihanna and Travis Scott and produced by the latter together with Deputy, Kanye West and WondaGurl. The song was digitally released as the second single from the album on March 26, 2015 via the iTunes Store.\n\n\"Bitch Better Have My Money\" is a trap song with a hip hop beat and represents a notable musical departure from the album's lead single, \"FourFiveSeconds\". Upon release critics gave the song lukewarm reviews, finding the song catchy and ready to be played in clubs, but thought it was a step down from the preceding single. To promote the song Rihanna gave an acclaimed performance at the 2nd iHeartRadio Music Awards on March 29, 2015\n\nLyrics Sub Stars 2015\n\nFollow me: \n\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/williamgordon13/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/williamsGordonZ?lang=es\n\nDownload \u201cBitch Better Have My Money\u201d here: http://smarturl.it/BBHMM?IQid=ytvevo\n\nRihannaVEVO\nP&amp;C 2015 Westbury Road Entertainment.

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I prefer tales of valor, growth, and heroism. Tales that have morals that tend to be missing from our daily lives.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It's a refreshing read after a long day of dealing with people, hmhm.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": I think, we still have them, they're just not that visible.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Books tend to exaggerate more on those traits.","d":"Jun 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Perhaps. But the impact of their existence would be a bit...lessened. Like, eventually, people would be <i>\u200bexpecting</i>\u200b the heroes at all times.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It's because we se so little of those values in this day and age that seeing them in stories is so.....","d":"Jun 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I suppose.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Sometimes,","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": the most heroic things","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": are really just the simple thing that you don't think about.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Because it's just there.","d":"Jun 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": But if you think about it, and think about it not being there.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Then it get scary.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yeah...I guess I just want more from the people around this world....I guess that comes from my lack of social interaction in my life.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But there isn't a human alive OR dead that can look at the whole world properly. Including me.","d":"Jun 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Mmm","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It's one of the reasons I tend to act...rather arrogant against certain players.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I want to see how they try to prove my 'beliefs' wrong. How they react to the challenge to their morals.","d":"Jun 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Just tell him that i'm keeping aclose eye on the player named Yuji. I've heard that the officers have been a bit wary of him, so I figured it might give him a bit of relief.","d":"Jun 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Mmm.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But yeah, I have an eagle eye on Yuji. Also, I have one other thing for you to tell Jean.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Mmm?","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": If Yuji does win the game, without changing....He needs to keep a close eye on him.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": CLOSER than before.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": .....","d":"Jun 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": I'll do my best.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":"<span style=\"color:#C79DD4;\"> but you're all making me wary of interacting with Yuji</span>","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": My belief is that the purpose of the game is to erase the corruptions within the hearts of the players. It won't sit well with me if he is revived with his current mindset.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Again, I'll do my best. But I can't be trying to help Yuji all the time.","d":"Jun 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": The game is pretty big","d":"Jun 2016"}
