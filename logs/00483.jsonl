{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Correct.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I see! Quite a difference from Fuwa requests! If you are not properly given all the details in the beginning, you have free reign to find a loophole!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": However, while Fuwa does wish to build trusting relationships with other districts, it does not tolerate the chance of betrayal from those who are not already allied with us! As such...","d":"May 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Much obliged! We hope that you will forgive us for this, but Fuwa has strict guidelines for repaer behaviour outside of the district!","d":"May 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I see! Not so different from Fuwa then, outside of more strict rules to follow!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": You gave your viewers the same experience as well.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": In Fuwa, we are given missios by our Leading GM and Officers. If we are given orders with vague requirements, however, we are free to find loopholes!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Of course, there are those who are deployed to deal with such troublemakers, however!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Well then, viewers, we just got a firsthand experience of the Shibuya Game style! What a marvelous experience it was!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Is Fuwa looking to make more alliances?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Fuwa is always looking to make new alliances with districts that have interesting players and merchandise!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": How ambitious.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Well, we need such things for our games!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": After all, without imported players and fasions, our game couldn't be run nearly as smoothly~","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Where do you rank, if I may ask?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I am a support reaper! I'm in charge of erasing players with noise, and setting up traps and barricades!","d":"May 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Oh? How interesting! May I inquire as to why?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> looks rather amused by this new name.</span>","d":"May 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Interesting! I certainly don't mind! It's rather refreshing to have a nickname that isn't a japanese warrior!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":"<span style=\"color:#6DB524;\"> takes his mask off..</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I'll show you around Shibuya.","d":"May 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": You don't seem to have a proper guide.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": The reapers of Fuwa, and I espescially, thank you!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": We cannot deploy many reapers here until we set up a contract, so we havent had much chance to mingle with the locals!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Our conductor, who has shown up here on occation, is too focused on sightseeing!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Conductors tend to be that way.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Ours is super lazy! He gets stuff done properly, but is super lazy about it!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> giggles</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": What do you want to know about this district?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Well, I can investigate the location easily enough on my own! So it's mostly the UG I would like to know about!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Fasions, the effect of fasions, means of combat, etc etc!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": And es[escially the players! We are quite curious as to the quality and lifestyle of players in this district!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Our only source of info seems to be a little biased, so extra opinions are welcome and desired!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I'm afraid I can't answer some of those questions.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Not because I don't want to, but because my game here was an anomaly.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Really? What sort of anomaly?!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> looks really excited.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I can't answer that.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": That's a shame!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> sounds a little dejected, but still looks quite excited.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": It was fun though.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Well, what few questions you can answer would be appreciated!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I've never been a reaper here, so I can't answer a lot.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> blinks</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Oh?! You aren't a Shibuya reaper?!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":"<span style=\"color:#6DB524;\"> smiles.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I was a Shibuyan player.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> eyes are sparkling.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Incredible! This is even better than meeting a Shibuya reaper!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I won my game despite how.....odd it was.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I see! In Fuwa, even in the oddest of cases, the rules are quite strict regarding who wins and loses!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": There's only been two individuals who can really be called \"Anomalies\"!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": But to have an entire game be an anomaly... how thriling!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Very.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": So what district ARE you from?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": As a reaper, i mean!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Not relevant.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Aww! What a shame!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> again, sounds and looks are not matching up.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Well then, back to Shibuya, how does combat in this game work?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Through the use of pins.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Pins are used as a medium for players to fight.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Pins?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> looks curious.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Oh!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": You mean like this!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> pulls a pin out of her pocket with a bull's head on it.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": The purple ninja gave me this to make me leave him alone once!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Correct.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Wooow~! So these little things are your weapons here, huh? In Fuwa we use replica weapons!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Pins are what have power in them, however players who find it difficult to use solely just the pins can channel their potential through an item of their choice.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Now that seems closer to Fuwa's style! Every player is given a replica weapon by the conductor upon becoming a player, and they channel their power into it!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Sounds cute.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Or upon entering the district if they're imported players!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Players dont get to choose their weapons though! Gotta adapt to what you're given!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I remember one player was actually just given a bell!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Sounds dangerous.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Very! I think he drove 3 or 4 enemy players insane with it! Couldn't tell you how, though!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": He's probably Daisoujou.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Ooo! Maybe! That would've been a good nickname to give him!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Sadly, he drove himself insane with it, and accidentally stumbled into one of my traps! Lost an arm! Still won though!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": He was fun to watch! The other reapers enjoyed seeing him play quite a bit!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Any questions you have for a player?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Well....Oh! How does the partner system in this district work? Is there a partner system? What happens if one partner dies? Or if they're too far from one another?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": You get one partner. If your partner dies, you die. If for any reason two players find themselves partnerless, they are able to pact with one another. Players are given one day to find a partner after their initial tutorial. Any players unable to find a partner after \"Day 1\" will be erased.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Oooh! Interesting!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": It's similar to Fuwa! But there's a few small differences!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Players arer GIVEN partners, as it's believed that they should be able to adapt to whoever they're stuck with, for better or worse! This happens on day 0 when harriers are being given their players! If one player dies, the partner dies! If partners are too far from each other, both die!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Players without partners on day 0 are forced to sit out, or play the game with a MASSIVE handicap!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":"<span style=\"color:#6DB524;\"> takes note of this</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Hey, Kappa.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": This also means that many support reapers work towards seperating partners from each other whenever possible!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Yes","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": ?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Why not try some Shibuyan food?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": That sounds nice!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":"<span style=\"color:#14C773;\"> looks excited.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": What would you like?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Anything is fine! I have no preferences!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Just something fresh, if you'd please! The conductor already brought tons of snacks and such back from Shibuya!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Let me try asking another way.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Would you like fast food or fancy food?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Fast food! I dont care much for fancy food! And I do have stuff to do eventually!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Gotta find the Composer and all that fun stuff!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I'd also like to find some Shibuya Reapers and learn how they work here!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": You're out of luck for now, friend.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":"<span style=\"color:#6DB524;\"> thinks.... last he remembers, Jean was standing in for composer and the actual one was gone.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Everyone sure likes to keep my brother busy..","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Really? But the purple ninja said that Jean should be around here somewhere!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Your viewers and yourself can wait a bit, yeah?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I suppose! The show must go on, after all, with or without the main star!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Good. The best thing about scoops and stories is building up the anticipation.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I suppose I could throw you a curveball.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": A fair point! But if there's too much filler, attention is quickly lost!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Jean is nii-san.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Oh? So your brother is the Composer?","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": how intriguing!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": For now.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":"<span style=\"color:#6DB524;\"> decides to play around with Erika... with half truths at least.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I'm also a conductor.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Is that right? The purple ninja didn't say much about the conductor....so I suppose i'll have to take your word for now!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Though it IS a little strange!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": I'm not Shibuya's conductor.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Oooh! I see! So you're conductor of your current district!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Technically, yes.","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": I thought it was a bit strange! The purple ninja said the conductor of Shibuya had a weird way of speaking!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Everyone has a weird way of speaking here..","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"14C773","n":"Erika","m":": Weirder than usual, he said!","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":": Still everyone..","d":"May 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6DB524","n":"Judai","m":"<span style=\"color:#6DB524;\"> as far he remembers at least.</span>","d":"May 2017"}
