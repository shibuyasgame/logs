{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": I'm curious to see how your seeming lack of care for your own life will impact your game.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": I'll do my best to make it clean and painless if you do.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": That's fine with me. Though may I request one thing?","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": I don't want Kyou, or whoever will be my partner, to die with me if they don't want to.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": You may request anything you wish. Whether that request will be filled is a different matter entirely.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": So! If they could find a partner right after I'm gone, that would be nice.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": Well, if you come looking to die while it's offweek, you won't have to worry about bringing anyone down with you.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": But there's no such guarantees during the game. You play to win. If you have no intention of doing such a thing, I recommend you not burden someone else with death by removing yourself from play.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": Mhm. I suppose so. Yet wouldn't dying offweek  be a burden too? Cause I know there are people who would be by it. Its an unfortunate truth. At the least, in-game I'll wait to the end.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": Ah, but the key difference is that no one goes poof into static if you're erased now.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": True, and yet for some reason, I just can't do that now.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": There's no rush. I do hope you won't be too passive during the Game though. It'd be a shame if your partner were to perish due to your lack of action.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": I'll fight as hard as I can with them. I won't let my own troubles affect them.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": I refuse to let anyone close to me die when I could've stopped it.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": Good. I applaud your resolve, and hope that it will not be shaken.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"77AEBF","n":"Corona","m":": Don't worry. That is the one thing I'm sure about.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"FF0000","n":"Hawk","m":": But I see you have things to attend to","d":"Oct 2016"}
