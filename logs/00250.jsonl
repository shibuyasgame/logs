There isn't an official title to this song so I just called it \"Deemo, Goodbye\" as a generic title that seems to fit the theme.  It's the cut scene that is triggered after finishing Fluquor.  This cut scene has to be the most significant of all the others because it reveals a huge plot info.  It's heartbreaking and emotionally bittersweet.\n\nI also added to this arrangement a part of cut scene 14 which follows Alice, the little girl, waking up from her comatose state.  The whole song starts of soft as Alice regains her memories of what happens.  The whole pieces swells into something powerful as Alice ascends out of the unknown world.  The break is to signify her awakening inside the hospital, hence the heartbeat and monitor sounds.  She finally awakes with all her memories intact and the piece ends solemnly and softly.\n\nFollow me on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/Zackamanz\nLike me on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/salamanzz\n\n___________________________\n*Please do not reproduce my material without my permission and consent*\nSheet Music Download:  https://www.mediafire.com/?32o07wry9i4nc3m\nMIDI Download: https://www.mediafire.com/?dln832xl835zejb</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span>"}
