{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": But what about  nightmares?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": I know that feeling well. I'm currently experiencing \"sleep deprevation.\" which is classified by overall sluggishness and a decreased will to live.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": The will to live part was a joke","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Alright, good... I was about to say...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Sasha","m":": The best part about sleep is that not everyone has dreams.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": That's unfortunate.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": The dream cycle of sleep is classified by the state of R.E.M. sleep (Rapid Eye Movement), which occurs in the last 3-4 hours of sleep. It's essential to your brain's daily rejuvination, and without it you would succumb to one of many physical limitations of the human body and promptly die. While not everyone remembers their dreams, everyone has them. It is essential to their vital rejuvination, something that I have not experienced due to \"sleep deprevation\".","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": That's why they say people need a minimum of 5 hours of sleep per night, to go through REM sleep...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": And isn't it said that people have hundreds of dreams a night, even if we can't see them?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": Sasha, is it possible that your death was resultant of insufficient R.E.M. sleep cycles?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": People have about 4 dreams per night due to the 4 stages of the R.E.M. cycles","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Sasha","m":": I see the bright side of things no nightmares, and you know you can condition your body to sleep in short spurts. it makes things no dreams possible","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Hm, I was misinformed...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Sasha","m":": I forget the word for it. Polypasic sleep or something","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": People need at least 5 hours of sleep to initiate the R.E.M. cycle, but about 7 or 8 to complete it. If you do not complete it, you will need to accumulate additional rest during the day through naps, or catching up on missed cycles during periods of respite.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Sleep is amazing, I'll put it at that.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Sasha","m":": I agree","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": Actually, Polyphasic sleep is often used to initiate lucid dreams, due to the controlled nature of the sleep cycles. Instead of avoiding dreams, doing so makes them more vivid.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": ((i actually know about this stuff im a hecking nerd im sorry o)-< ))","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Controlling dreams sounds like it would be cool.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": What issue are you referring to?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Sasha","m":": The issue of having dreams? Or more so, remembering them if it were the case. The last time I dreamed of something it was when I was a child.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": Controlling dreaqms is based on numerous factors, but has many beneficial psychological factors, such as coming to terms with traumatic events, realizing what subcsonscious fears are, and making cool dubstep songs without prior knowledge of music theory. It is indeed <i> cool.</i>","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": It is possible to train yourself to remember dreams. Would you like to be provided <i>\"Complimentary training\"</i>?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Sasha","m":": The thing is would remembering these dreams be helpful or hurtful?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": As I stated in the past, having a grasp on your dreams  has many beneficial psychological factors, such as coming to terms with traumatic events, realizing what subcsonscious fears are, and making cool dubstep songs without prior knowledge of music theory. While it may be hard to confront psychological traumas, it would indeed have benefits in the long run.","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": The first step to remembering dreams is simple. Just by thinking about this information on a regular basis greatly increases your chances, so keep it in mind. Next, keeping a dream journal where you record your hallucinations, out of body experiences, and small glimpses of dreams will make your next dreams much more vivid than those previous. Those are the two main steps, but other methods would be medicinal and recreational herbs, or as \"Snoop Dogg\" would say <i> Smoke weed errydaaeyy</i>","d":"Feb 2015"}
