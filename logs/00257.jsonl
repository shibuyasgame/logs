{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": The bats left him at the entrance to a cave, a long, winding tunnel of a cave that no bat (strangely enough) dared enter. Danger, they squeaked, fluttering all around, but then departed and let him be.","d":"Oct 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": He and his steed went into the cave, and did not fear when it was dark, or when his torch sputtered and died and left them there in the unknown. He was confident that he could find Ichigo and wouldn't let something like darkness stop him. After all, it's not darkness that's scary, but what lurks therein.","d":"Oct 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Carefully, Sora ventured on forth, checking every step before he put his foot down, feeling the walls for hidden passages, and always, always listening very intently for anything coming.

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": After who knows how long, he finally made it out of the cave. He didn't understand what he saw when the light hit his eyes, for he'd been so long without it, it was quite painful. The light had not hurt him before. Perhaps that was just a side effect of having exited into the demon kingdom, for when he regains his sight the sudden light had briefly stolen from him, he sees the harsh landscape and craggy surfaces and knows he is no longer at home.","d":"Oct 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": At the edge of the leftmost path, he sees something. Something dead and shriveled, but familiar nonetheless. The petal of a white rose. A flower he didn't think grew in the demonic kingdom... but something small and insignificant enough that the princess he so loved could have let it fall and have it escape her kidnapper's notice.

It wound and twisted and sometimes turned illusory, but every time, he looked for the petal of a rose that would inevitably be there, and continued to follow the trail. It would have been a faster journey for the demon lord, he was sure, but Sora was not assisted by magic, so could not match his speed.","d":"Oct 2015"}

Sora raised his sword and prepared for battle, but stopped as the monster spoke. Wait, it said, mangled tongue contorting the language until it was all he could do to understand. Wait, for you are not like those others who have come along here.","d":"Oct 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Nothing, Sora replied, for I am bound on my honour to seek the princess I love, and who loves me. I am sorry for your fate, but short of killing me, you cannot stop me from passing. And even then, the knight knew, he would find a way somehow. He would not let his princess down.","d":"Oct 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": But Sora did not feel right about killing such a tormented creature, not when it seemed to have kindness left to it still. He could not sympathise with it, no. He could only show it some mercy, as it had tried to do to him. It had sensed that he was good, and tried to spare him, but he... he /had/ to continue on.","d":"Oct 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": He was the best knight in his realm, and that level of skill he possessed came into play now. For hours until the creature tired, he managed to duel it, taking scratches and blows from its thick, gnarled hide, but at sundown it had collapsed and he remained. It stared up at him with mismatched eyes, and he nodded to it (for it had been a worthy opponent), then rode on.","d":"Oct 2015"}

Sometimes the trail passed through cities, and he had to fight his way free, for he was no demon, and was far too mighty to be a simply subjugated slave. Sometimes, though, the slaves hid him, and smuggled him out, and he got away without spilling any more blood. In the cities, the slaves whispered to him of the princess, the beautiful girl they had seen. When he was out in the wilderness, though, he just followed the petals, and knew the princess had gone this way.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": He lost track of how long he searched for her a long time ago, but that didn't matter to him. He knew it in his heart that she was still alive-- the demon lord would have no use for a dead princess, and he supposed he would have felt it if she'd passed from this plane. Eventually, though, he made it. He reached his goal.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": The demon lord's palace... the inner sanctum burning bright in a pit of deepest hellfire, surrounded and protected by bars made of entwined and tortured souls. Sora looked up at the looming darksteel gates and, because he was a brave and honourable knight, knocked three times.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": To his surprise, the gates swung open just enough to allow him to slip onto a narrow pathway. He followed this down, down, down into the burning palace, until he came into an ornate chamber. There, Karin himself rested on a blazing throne, and stared at the knight who had come to challenge him, his eyes bright with the same fire that licked all around him. \"You have come at last,\" he said.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Sora was a bit taken aback that Karin had been, it seemed, expecting him... but rallied quickly, for it would do no good to show weakness in front of such a man. \"I'm here for the princess.\"","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": \"I know,\" the demon lord replied, staring down at the brave knight with something that was an awful lot like sorrow in his eyes. \"You always are.\"","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": This startled Sora even more than before, because nothing like this had ever happened before. He readied his sword to charge, having given the demon lord fair warning, but Karin kept talking nonetheless.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": \"This isn't the first time she's had you looking for her. You may not remember... but I do. A cycle that will last for all eternity, it seems. Do I kidnap her, Sora, or does she run to me, knowing it will draw your attention?\" That was the question the demon lord posed, and it gave Sora pause.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": The two fight, a mighty battle that rages on far past the point either of them can take, their swords clashing off of each other time and time again. Karin is bolstered by his own infernal reserves of power, and Sora by the force of his faith and love.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Eventually, Karin makes a mistake. A mistake he shouldn't have made, and Sora catches that brief slip in his guard with the point of his sword, but he has to wonder. Why? It was almost like the demon lord... was deliberately allowing himself to fail.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": As Sora stood over the fallen lord, he stared down into his eyes of burnished gold, the only part of him visible through the iron mask he wears. \"I don't care what you have to say,\" he says at long last. \"About any of this game nonsense. I'll follow Ichigo to the ends of the earth if you take her there... and as for what's right or wrong...\" As for who the villain should be... \"I'll forge my own path, according to my knightly code. And right now, what's right for me is protecting her.\"","d":"Oct 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": He wedged the tip of his sword under the demon lord's mask and levered it up, prying it away to see the face that was hidden beneath. What he saw there once more gave him pause, for the face of the demon lord, the face of this cruel tyrant... could very well have been brother to Ichigo's own.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Karin blinked up at him, his soot-blackened lips curving up into a cruel smile, but he did not speak, and his visage did not deter Sora for long. He brought his bright shining sword crashing down on the demon lord's body, severing his head in one blow. The corpse was turning to ash and an oily black smoke before he could even be sure Karin was dead.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Nonetheless, he watched until it was all dissolved, then carried on through a door behind the throne which opened up to let him through. There he found Ichigo, radiant in a pure white gown. Those last vestiges of doubt he had melted away at once as she smiled to see him and threw herself into his arms.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": He took her back to the human kingdom in a journey that seemed somehow easier than the one he had made to this one. Everything in the demon kingdom seemed to shrink away from them, even the warped monster which had told Sora he was pure of heart.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": The human kingdom rallied with their princess returned to them, just as the demon one failed with their lord dead. Soon, peace was restored to the lands. The human king agreed to Ichigo's request to give Sora her hand in marriage, and in the ceremony, he swore again to be with her and protect her always.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Nobody saw the way her smile was just a bit darker than it should have been behind the veil. And if Sora's recollections of what exactly had happened in that infernal palace were a bit fuzzier than they had been after she kissed him, well, that's just how memory works given time.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": A long ways away in a cabin in the woods, a midwife who distinctly remembered delivering twin royal babies mysteriously died. But no one knew, and they were happy. The two of them eventually ruled well and justly over the human kingdom after the current monarchs died\u2026","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Sometimes, Sora had doubts again, but when Ichigo kissed him so sweetly, eyes shining with the power of her love, those faded away. No matter what\u2026 no matter if this was all part of some game\u2026 he knew in those moments he did not care.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Some may speak of good and evil, of right and wrong, as absolute concepts and nothing more\u2026 but what was right for him and always had been was serving her, loving her, protecting her.","d":"Oct 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": They ruled together for eternity. Together, forever. That\u2026 was their story of paradise.","d":"Oct 2015"}
