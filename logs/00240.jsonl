At the start of Day One, I lost my ability to sing. Luna kept hers, and... kept singing.

Never actually hurt each other. The two of us were going to get out /together/, win /together/, or not at all. Even when I was scared and didn't think I could make it, that I would just be useless, I kept fighting for her. When she felt she was scared and selfish and didn't deserve to come back to life as opposed to anyone else who'd been erased, she kept fighting for me. We had to keep fighting for each other. No matter what. Because our lives were tied to each other... to not fight meant to kill each other. We clung to each other instead... and tried to give each other the strength necessary to continue on. She fought for you, in the end. To get back and see you, one last time.

{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": This sure is an interesting place.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": In the final battle, she was beautiful. She was /brilliant/.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": There were eight of us left. Seven of us were united by hatred and anger.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... and then there was Luna.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> still listening, quiet once more.</span>","d":"Sep 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Over the course of the Week, we'd gotten good at talking people through their problems, playing amateur therapist, and trying to use the true power of friendship and kindness to redeem everyone we met. It was working on the foreign reapers. On everyone. Far too well.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... Luna was the only one who didn't stop when it came to Jessamyn.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": Jessamyn?","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": The GM of that week. Her character can be summed up in one word-- yandere.","d":"Sep 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": We were fighting, and Luna was talking. The other seven of us hated Jess by then. Or... rather, I... still loved her... it doesn't matter now. But Luna was talking. She was trying to convince Jess that it didn't have to be this way-- Jess /hated/ the Game. Luna was the one who said that nobody else had to die, that Jessamyn could be forgiven, that we could all walk out of here. That we'd come back and visit Jess like we would our reaper friends.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... it got the other seven of us to stop, and think a bit.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Asahi never believed it for a moment. He couldn't stop trying to take Jess down.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": The rest of us... or, mostly...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": We started trying, too.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": To try to convince Jess that it didn't have to be like this. That she didn't have to kill us and we didn't have to kill her and there could be some fucked up happy ending.","d":"Sep 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Of... of everything... to have overlooked, she didn't... have a healing pin...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I should have got her one, but I thought she'd get it on her own, that it'd be fine... and then... she was poisoned.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": She was always more concerned with being on the offense. I suppose it never occurred to her.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I saw how much the poison was affecting her. Every time she moved. Three more turns, and...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": And it all fell apart?","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... in three turns, she was going to die, and there was nothing, not a thing, that either she or I or /anyone/ could do aside from stand there and fight and watch her be drained.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": And if your partner is erased... you only have seven minutes left to live without a pact.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": ...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I held her as she died. I clung to her even more and I thought that it'd be over for me in seven minutes too. I told her I loved her. Again.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... and then the announcement came as she shattered to static in my arms. 'Luna has been erased.'","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> is silently holding back tears. It's one thing to know something, and another to know the details.</span>","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... and then the announcement I wasn't expecting came. 'Altair has been erased.' Leaving his partner Asahi standing there alone, just as heartbroken as I was.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Asahi and I repacted to save our lives and had to keep on fighting, even if we didn't want to... for each other, and for the other four. Juste, Misae, Kafu, and Miyu...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... it wasn't too long afterwards that Misae and Miyu were erased in the same move.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Juste and Kafu repacted.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": And then... and then...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": It started... working...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": What did?","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": What Luna had started... was working, and Jessamyn began to attack herself... instead of us... she just wanted it to be over...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": All four of us lost our partners in that fight, the one thing we thought would never happen. None of us ever expected to be able to keep fighting and carry on without them. It was assumed that, in a fight, we'd die.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": But in the end... they died, and we're... still here.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": The last thing she told me was to tell you everything that happened, to be happy, and to light the whole fucking district on fire.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": ...Then I guess I've finally got something to strive for.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Sol? If you do nothing else, /get a fucking healing pin/.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": I'll make sure of it.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Good. You can't go down like she did.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": First, though, I'm going to need some matches...","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I can help with those.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": And I fully intend to survive. Somebody has to make sure no one is forgotten, don't they?","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I mean, the four of us are doing that ourselves, but... yeah. Keep up that fighting spirit.","d":"Sep 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> holds out the fluffy patchwork cat. \"But if I do burn as short and bright as she did... Will you hold onto this? She trusted you with it before, after all.\"</span>","d":"Sep 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": Oh, and flowers, as well as the matches. A very special rock needs some decoration.","d":"Sep 2015"}
