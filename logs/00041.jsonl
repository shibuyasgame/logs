{"t":"div","m":"<p>So, I'm gonna have to type this up again, unfortunately. My first dream that I remember wasn't a lucid dream since I couldn't completely control it. I did make small decisions, however.</p><p>The first part I remember is that I was going to the store with my dad for some reason, and as we're walking in I suddenly collapse. It gets hard for me to breathe and I shake immensely, I could almost feel it. My dad calls my aunt and she comes to help me. This may be a normal happening(so I make it sound like) but I'm laying there thinking that I was chosen for something special. Like the people in Under the Dome, for instance. After recovering from the incident, I end up at home sitting down and watching TV with my mom. After only about 30 or so seconds of actually watching, suddenly I'm inside the TV and part of the TV show. It was about how the world ended. Inside the \"show\" I met this guy who calls himself an alien, and he wants to help Earth by telling me what to do. We went to a building made of ice. The walls, the floor, every part was covered in ice. We start walking around and I have no clue what we're looking for. In one of the rooms we go to, I start stomping on the floor in hopes I'd find something, but to no avail. This guy(I think his name was Drake from the dream, or maybe he never said his name. Well, he's Drake now) walks over to the corner of the room, takes a random staff, and sticks it into a block of ice. The ice breaks, and the earth under it begins to collapse. For some reason, the earth looked like Minecraft blocks. Video games, yo. Guess I play too many. Drake orders me to go down and pull a switch down. So, I walk down and am somehow unharmed by lava. I find the switch after not too long and pull it down. The dream ended, and I woke up. It was around 5:30 AM at this point so I go back to a dreamless sleep.</p><p>I wake up again around 6. Realizing it's too early and that I'd have to get up in just a little while anyways, I rest in my bed with my eyes closed. Of course, I fall asleep and this starts another whole dream. This one was much shorter, trust me. I end up in a 2D world. For some reason I look like Samus. I look right and left. No clue what the hell's going on. This one must've been a lucid dream since I remember and controlled everything that happened. Another guy that looked just like my character in the game started to chase me and fire his gun at me. So, I run away, avoiding obstacles, the bullets fired at me, and random monsters. I messed up one time and hit a wall, falling into a pit. I woke up again, around 6:30. That dream reminded me a lot of the game Contra.</p><p>Weird dreams, huh?</p><p>~Vince~</p>"}

Song belongs to Bushiroad and TV Tokyo.  I own nothing. SUBBED LYRICS NOW IN DESCRIPTION!!\n\nSo, I'm sorry if the lyrics are a bit late! I use Windows Movie Maker, which is probably not the best thing to make lyric videos with.\n\nOkay, this is obviously Psyqualia Ren singing.  I've watched enough anime so that I can actually understand most of what he's singing, and I'm just thinking 'Oh Ren...'  He's actually singing about his Psyqualia and how he'll rule the world with the power.  Wow....\n\nSubbed Lyrics:\n\nPSY QUALIA ... PSY QUALIA ... PSY QUALIA ...\n\nNobody can hear the voice ...\nOnly I was given the power!\nI'm the chosen one who was chosen Vanguard Fight!\nI can see, Yes ... I know your defeat is decided!\nOK, it's the end ... Next is Final Turn!\n\nThere is only victory for me, running away is not allowed,\nBy being lead by this voice, which only the chosen have\n\nWhen the overlord appears over the world\nEverybody will cower before the fear of the unknown\n\nThe card far and wide, the power to subdue,\nI invite you with my power to come to new heights\nOnly I can see the end of the image\nYour rotting figure... come on, let's end it right now\n\nThere is no losing for me, I have the skills to stand up before you\n\"Despair to the hopeless, and glory to all the ones with power!\"\n\nI'll show you an eternal darkness\nIf you stand foolishly in my way!\n\nAll the power against you to demean you\nWas born from a great hatred where it was given birth\nOnly I can give humiliation to you\nYou will rot starting now... come on, let's end it right now\n\nThe power to subdue your fate far and wide\nThe strongest, satisfying, amazing power\nOnly I can tell you when it's Final Turn\nThe future where you'll rot to the ground... come on, let's end it right now</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span>"}
