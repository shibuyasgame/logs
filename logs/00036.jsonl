SUBSCRIBE to the TEDx channel: http://bit.ly/1FAg8hB\n\nTom Thum: Armed with just a microphone, Thum pushes the limits of the human voice to create incredible soundtracks of impossible beats and phenomenal sounds, with scratched vinyl, the Michael Jackson back-catalogue, the didgeridoo and an entire fifties jazz band amongst his vocal repertoire. \n\nYou can follow Tom on FaceBook (TomThummer) and Twitter (@tomthummer)\n\nQuoting from ABC's Triple J Unearthed website:\n\n\"TOM THUM, THE VERSATILE VOICEBOX 'Tom Thum appears to have swallowed an entire orchestra and several backing singers' The Guardian (UK)\n\n'There are not enough superlatives to describe the wonder of this beatboxing virtuoso - I am still trying to figure out how he got those sounds out of his mouth' The Daily Telegraph (UK)\n'The mic master seems to have an orchestra living in his throat: trumpet blasts, guitar strums and samples from classic songs including Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" effortlessly spout from his mouth' Time Out, NY\n\nThese are apt quotes to describe the performance of one of Australia's most prominent and respected beatboxers and serial pests. Only in his mid-twenties Tom Thum has achieved and experienced more than most artists could hope to achieve in a lifetime. From winning the team battles (alongside Joel Turner) in the World Beatbox Championships in 2005, to fulfilling every artists dream and performing on Broadway in New York with the Tom Tom Crew, Tom has seen his fair share of accolades and well and truly paid his dues. Raised by the small but accommodating Brisbane hip hop scene, Tom started out as a graffiti writer and a Bboy but slowly rose to recognition through his ability to produce unhuman sounds and his natural knack for performing and weaselling his way on stage...\n\nAlthough the stage seems the ideal habitat for Tom he is also no stranger to community and has been helping the scene improve through conducting a plethora of workshops in many places that usually wouldn't have access to such knowledge and skill. Tom has travelled from the very top of Australia teaching in the Indigenous communities of Mornington and Thursday Islands all the way to the very bottom with a series of workshops in Tasmania and Adelaide. \n\nHe has also spent considerable time teaching on Palm Island and in Charleville and many other places that would otherwise be Starved for education about proper hip hop and the positive message that music preaches.\n\nAs Tom's experience within the music industry expands, he plans to push the limits of the human voice as far as inhumanly possible. Enrolling the help of numerous loop stations, Tom has been conducting DJ sets using only his voice and nothing else, propelling crowds across the country into a frenzy of jaw-dropping disbelief, as he re-creates and remixes classic joints and jams from all eras and genres. At present Tom is working on an album ranging across many different generes and features and hopes to have it finished by early 2012. You might see him on a stage at a festival looping up a storm or supporting anyone from the Hilltop Hoods to Blue King Brown, or you might catch him annoying the hell out of commuters on public transport. Either way, you will notice him soon enough. Keep an ear out for Tom Thum.\"\n\nSee more at: http://tedxsydney.com\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

This massive project is a belated thank you from me to you guys for the 50,000 subscribers - still unreal, and very much appreciated!   \n\nThe video took me a whole season to complete.  Some scenes still make my hand ache (I'm looking at YOU, zebra herd).\n\nI will most likely be re-mixing this song for my next vocal CD, but I am offering this particular mix of the song as a single on itunes and Loudr.  I had it studio mastered a few days ago for you guys.  Any proceeds will help me pay my medical bills for the checkups and treatments for my vocal cord nodes o_o;   (I am better now, and starting to sing again, but definitely a little in debt from the whole experience, so any support will help a lot right now  ;_;)\n\niTunes - Apple mp3\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/across-the-sunlands-single/id700915037\n\nLoudr (for FLAC and mp3 format)\nhttp://www.loudr.fm/release/across-the-sunlands/kFG7R\n\n\nAnyways, I hope you guys will enjoy it!   I am sorry it is not a new video game cover, I've been wanting to work on them very badly, but was unable to sing these last few months.  Trying to get back up to snuff as soon as I can :)\n\nAcross the Sunlands \u00a9 2013 \ncomposed, arranged, and performed by Erutan.</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span> ))"}
