{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": What do you mean?","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": Well to be quite honest, you were very predictable and just plain....how should I put it, pathetic, during the week","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": Which was why I had no problem letting you go on vacation","d":"Mar 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": However...your sufficiency in paperwork is impressive","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": Perhaps I missed something during the week. I'd like to see if there is more to you than what i saw","d":"Mar 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": Of course, sir.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": If there is anything you could inform me of now that might help with future weeks, I'd be willing to listen","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": ...Like... what? In terms of overall suggestions for improvements of the Game?","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": Just anything, even about yourself in general. However I won't pry if you wish not to speak","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": ...I... would like to explain further about my history as a Reaper, if I may.","d":"Mar 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":"<span style=\"color:#9F61E8;\"> nods and sits down also, placing the folders down beside him.</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": Mm... First of all, are you familiar at all with the Kawasaki District?","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": vaguely. I've heard there are high erasure rates between both players and reapers, correct?","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": ...Yes. The games were fairly full and happened about once a month. Only 4 Players were allowed to win, and so 36 Players were erased once a month.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": To keep the balance of Soul, all Reapers were required to erase one entire partnership each game.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":"<span style=\"color:#00BFFF;\"> nods and gestures for jean to continue</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": Mm... each game, the entry fee is something about yourself that you have actively improved on. Whether that be your assertiveness, or your self esteem, or your social skills, it's taken away. Because there were few winners, it was logical to take an entry fee that would hinder your performance.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": My entry fee was my self control. It was something I had issues with as a child, but worked on while I was in high school. So... because my partner was erased during the game and I was offered Reaperdom, I didn't win it back.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": So... I had to build it back up again, as a Reaper. It was a bit easier the second time around.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": ...But... the game was... awful. It was completely unlike Shibuya. There was absolutely no emotional attachment to anyone; not Players, not even your fellow Reapers.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":"<span style=\"color:#00BFFF;\"> nods slowly</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": I got laughed at for attempting to save a Player from erasure after trying to save their Partner... It was just a bloodbath. And erasing so many Players, you... got used to it. I've erased over a hundred Players in two years just for my own survival, and I felt nothing after a while.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":"<span style=\"color:#9F61E8;\"> laughs bitterly and shakes his head</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": There are quite a few districts like that Jean","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": Seeing so many Players get erased, both by Reapers and by themselves... I felt inhuman. I couldn't handle it anymore, and all of the Reapers that I had started with were long gone due to self erasure as well.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":"<span style=\"color:#00BFFF;\"> looks ahead but continues to listen</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": So what brought you here?","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": Mhm... I understand that. I do not believe many districts have such a high rate of self erasure, though... I believe Kawasaki's nickname is the \"Suicide Game\"?","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": I heard that Shibuya's game focused more on the development of the Players, and I needed a change.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":"<span style=\"color:#9F61E8;\"> ...nods.</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": I... let my guard down far too much, though. I let myself get too attached to some of the Players, like Sayoko and Kogasa. <s>And Aiichirou.</s>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": Well....change is good, and Shibuya is focused on change indeed","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":"<span style=\"color:#00BFFF;\"> shakes head and turns to Jean</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": that's not really an excuse for attempting to erase yourself. This is Shibuya, <i>not</i> Kawasaki","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": I understand that, sir.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": If you understand I hope you'll learn from it","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": It's more... I was called a monster by some Players, and I didn't feel as if I belonged here because of how I couldn't restrain myself from being attached.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":"<span style=\"color:#00BFFF;\"> single laugh and shakes head</span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": I knew I wouldn't belong either if I was completely detached either, I wouldn't be helping the Players.","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": Jean","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": shut up","d":"Mar 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": There is no \"belonging\" in Shibuya. Do not change because you're in a different place to fit in, change because you desire to change yourself and who you are","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": you are allowed to be attached to players","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"00BFFF","n":"Kei","m":": In case you didn't realize, there were a few I was partial to myself","d":"Mar 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":"<span style=\"color:#9F61E8;\"> <s>yes i did realize that sir</s></span>","d":"Mar 2015"}
