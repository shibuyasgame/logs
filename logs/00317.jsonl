{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Mmmm, you might want to talk to some of the ex-players? Some of them still keep in touch with us reapers and some current players. But from the sound of it, it seems like you're done with RG.","d":"Apr 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": But again, no one's chance of surviving are very high until the game start.","d":"Apr 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": It was never a life I wanted to live, really. Always sick, always careful. Here, I can do almost anything, within some form of reason.","d":"Apr 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": So I guess staying here is all I really know. But if I became a Reaper, I'd be able to see the outside world, right?","d":"Apr 2016"}
