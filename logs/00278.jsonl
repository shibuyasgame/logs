{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": Nope. Spent my entire life studying--","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": So being a Reaper kinda works for me, I guess.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"32C6A6","n":"Takumi","m":": Ah... I feel the same way about Reaperhood. Then, how did you change when you Played, and became a Reaper?","d":"Nov 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": ......mm.","d":"Nov 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": Anyway! After that, the Reaper's life it was for me.","d":"Nov 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"32C6A6","n":"Takumi","m":": You've been a Reaper a bit longer than me, then... but--","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"32C6A6","n":"Takumi","m":": -- when did you become so vibrant, then, physically?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": I've always liked this sort of stuff. Fairytales and the like.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": Ever since I was little, so after I became a Reaper, I was... well. Free?","d":"Nov 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": Which is weird. But I could do whatever I wanted, so. I did.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"32C6A6","n":"Takumi","m":": Ah, I was also similar... though partly because of Harajuku's rules.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"4697B0","n":"Nagito","m":": What're the rules there like?","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"32C6A6","n":"Takumi","m":": Ohhh. It's strict by necessity, so if you don't follow you're erased on the spot... Let's see.","d":"Nov 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"32C6A6","n":"Takumi","m":": It's Harajuku, so you need to be dressed in one street fashion style at all times, as a Reaper. You also have to act in a manner that suits it.","d":"Nov 2015"}
