{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": .......I see....","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": So, you'll be joining next game?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": That's the plan. I'm having a handful of doubts, but currently, i'll be a harrier next game.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":"<span style=\"color:#C79DD4;\"> ah, a harrier</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": So why shouldn't I be energetic?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hmmm. I suppose. I'm not much of an outdoors type, so I guess I just dont feel it as much.","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So then, what do shibuya reapers generally do in their free time?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": ......uhhh....whatever they want? Get a job?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I mostly just follow Uso around absentmindedly, so i'm drawing a blank now that i've been away from her for a while.","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I usually just spook RGers by appearing and disappearing before them. Only the more woozy ones.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": That count as a hobby?","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Any idea what you're going to sell?","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": I see","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": For the most part, I guess I just feel restless. I knew that this district wasn't the most eventful between weeks, but still, I am a man who likes to be doing something productive. Even in Odaiba I had that problem.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": I see. Hopefully the shop will keep you busy enough.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And It's not like I can train my noise form, considering how my battle form can only come out in the noise plane.....","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": I see","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I always imagine going into noise form as becoming the form itself. Feeling as if you ARE that form. Helps to keep control of it.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And turning back means becoming human again.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Not easy going from 8 legs and no arms to 2 legs, 2 arms, and 2 wings.","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": An interesting choice nonetheless.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": I didn't really chose it? Actually, I never really thought about it, or even use it until a few games ago.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Most people I know  end up as more common things, like tigers.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I would think that having such a unique form is a testament to your imagination, hmhm.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Ah.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": I doubt it. These things just happens. But I think a polecat suit me","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": When I first learned to transform into a noise form, I used a certain method I thought of.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": oh?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I thought of something akin to a spirit animal. Then I imagined BEING that animal, feeling as if I had it's arms and legs and mannerisms, then I imagined my own personal touch, and finally, I put it into practice.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Ah,","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I've been helping teach a couple newer reapers here that method as well. One of them ended up a swan, who tried to eat me.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The other was Uso, who chose a snake as her animal.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": ......oh","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": ....I'm not even surprised.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Haha","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Speaking of which, what are harriers like during the games here? Uso's planning on becoming one, so I wanna help give her some pointers.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Oh, hmmm","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But Odaiba's games are kind of different, so my knowledge isn't the best.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": well, some are excited about doing erasures, but they usually change their tune, or are, just all talk and no action til nearly end of the week.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": But a lot of reapers here do care about the players.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": And just want to help.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Mmmm.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> smiles a small bit.</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": That's good to hear....though I hope it's truly helping rather than unintentionally hurting.","d":"Dec 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I employ a method of tough love, to an extent.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Ah?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I try to keep them improving through fighting and mental provocation when I can.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But the problem is, a lot of players don't realize how....IMPORTANT it is to change.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Ah...but fighting is not always a way to push them to change.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Sometimes, they just do need a talk.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": No, it most certainly is not. But then again, the same can be said about talking, no?","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Mmmm","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I trust the supports reapers, and other players to handle the talking. As a harrier, I see it as my duty to train them up physically...and show them what happens to those who refuse to change.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": ......","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": That makes sense.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I don't like erasing players. But I DO see it as necessary. I try to wait til day 6 to make any direct judgements on their change, however.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": To judge them day by day would be foolish after all.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Ah. It would be. But I'm glad you're at least willing to wait. Some reapers, tend to try and jump the gun.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Of course. I do still fight players with noise, but that is mostly to train them, and try and fight them emotionally.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Some people, just want their erasure out of the way early. So","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":"<span style=\"color:#C79DD4;\"> shrugs</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": If they cannot handle the training, I may show mercy once or twice....but I need an erasure eventually.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": ....Yeah","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": That's why I generally targer a weak link of the players. I don't want to destroy those who show potential.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And the week that there's not a single weak link....well, that's a week worth dying again for.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Ah....","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": ....I became a harrier because I wanted players to grow. Not to merely solve their problems, bt truly grow.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": To overcome hardships. To overcome any hurdle set before them.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And to truly appreciate their second chance.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": ....that's a nice goal.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": When I see people wasting that chance....people who refuse to change their ways....the ways that got them KILLED.....","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> sighs</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": ...I get it. At least, you try.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yeah....but I can always try harder.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": All we can do is try.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": It never matters how hard we try. So","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":"<span style=\"color:#C79DD4;\"> shrugs</span>","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hmmm....you'd be suprised.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But thank you nonetheless.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"C79DD4","n":"Nora","m":": Mmmm","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Uso's a little too fresh to fully understand the weight of this job, and Odaiba's reapers generally don't like me and my moe aggressive training methods.","d":"Dec 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So it feels good to talk with someone like this.","d":"Dec 2015"}
