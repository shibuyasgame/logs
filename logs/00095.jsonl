This fate cannot be unwound\n\nSucceeding, succeeding, succeeding, boss-to-be, can't wait to meet\n\nFate, dream, and, live and, think and, die on the ground now\nThey fall so in love then watch it come falling down\nSoftly he's snickering, the smiling snake\n\"How stupid can they be?\"\n\nAh ta-ta-tell me why I can't get enough\nGotta break it, the shaking hearts that never give up\nHaunting their tauntingly inadequate lives\nI'm buried in their eyes\n\nRight, it's living in you, crawling inside?\nThe power digging deep, able to \"meet their eyes\"\n\nIn this cold as stone, real tragedy, you'd be the queen\n\nCheers to the years and life you made\nLove and your ego slip and snake\nHazy days all around as they come billowing down\nBack to page one where this story started really getting gory\n\n\"Please, give it back!\" you screech and scream\n\"Stop this already\" quite the plea\nOh you think that I care? Well life's just one fated snare\n\nWelcome to horrible, pitiful, fictional, reality\n\nAh what a stupid way to live\nTry try again you just resist\nWanna turn back the page, reset the actors on stage\nKnock knock it down as you're heaving\n\nHowling, even louder screaming\n\nAh what an ugly way live! \nDon't even ask me \"Why\" again\nYou're just bleeding with greed, and doing time for the crime \nBelieving miracles empty, breaking into pieces plenty\n\n\"Done with it all! I just don't care\"\nHelpless and crying, you sit there\n\nBut that's all I will say, THE END is fading away\n\nDay after, day after, kids of tomorrow\nDay after, day after, sunset\nDay after, day after, day after, laugh in the haze!</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span> me too"}
