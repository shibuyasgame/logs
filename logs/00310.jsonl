{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Sentimental? Nah. Just it's really easy to keep money when you're dead.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Don't got to pay much for food, or a place to sleep, or even clothes. Get money for killing you saps... makes it hell of a lot easier to smuggle goods.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Wow this whole game deal sounds like some real black market shit.","d":"Mar 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": The game is actually quite healthy stuff. Builds character. Normally people like you have no chance at salvation.","d":"Mar 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": So like.... how many dead kids are usually brought into this whole business?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Depends on the district. If I remember numbers proper, an average of 20 suckers are brought in per game, and there's usually a long rest period between breaks to allow for more people to gather.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Is it just kids?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": In the Nara City District, the Reaper's Game is continuous. Hundreds of people every week, no rest period between weeks. We basically have weekly shifts there!","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Well, I think I've only seen kids here. No one really that old.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Shame, too. Kids aren't really all that nice for making out.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": among... other things.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Wow, Nara sounds like a shit storm. Glad I'm in Shibuya then--20 sounds like a reasonable number.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": And... yeah.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Generally not, if you're thinkin' what I think you're thinking.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Nara's kinda the origin of a lot of Buddhist temples, so the games there operate like how Buddhists interpreted the afterlife!","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Like an actual court of law. But with more killing.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Yeah, killing sounds reeeeeal Buddhist.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": ... But I getcha, I think.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":"<span style=\"color:#A3CC52;\"> laughs</span>","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Honestly though, I'm not making much money here. Shibuya's kinda just a vacation for me. I'm gonna drift off somewhere else later. I'm thinking Rikuzentakata.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Holy shit. So re-killin' dead kids is vacation for ya? I'd hate to see what work is like.","d":"Mar 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Well, yeah. It's part of the job. Kinda.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": It's also cause I'm interested in learning about it. Death.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": ... Yeah?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": You mortals show some... really interesting reactions to death. Accepting it, defying it, or... something in the middle. It's so mysterious.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": I think if I learn more about you mortals and death, I think I'll learn more about myself when I died.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": .... I can see that, yeah. People are strange that way.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Do you not remember how you died? Or just like... how you were before you died?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": How I was...","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Mannn, just how long have you been here for?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Like... here as in dead.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Mm... a while.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Well I'd assumed so, but....","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": .... Guess that's kinda a personal question, actually.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": Hehe, well I don't mind giving that information, but in exchange","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": I'd wanna know information about you!","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Ehhh, that's fine I guess. Whaddaya wanna know?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": What do you think your friends are doing right now? Have you tried to contact them?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Haven't really thought about it. think I just died like.... t'day or somethin'. Maybe a day ago? It's hard to tell. They're tough as nails, though, so they should be fine.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Knowing them, they're probably playin' baseball in the dark after curfew or something.","d":"Mar 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Not enough for ya?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": No no, that's pretty good. I guess I'll tell you as well","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A3CC52","n":"Nanami","m":": It's been... about 6 years? I think?","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Shit, that is a long time. Well... relatively, I guess. Are there any reapers y'know who're like.... suuuuper old?","d":"Mar 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Well for one, instead of chucking the ball to the bases to try and get people out, ya lob it as hard as you can at the people who're running bases.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": It's also tackle. So all the outfielders have gotta tackle the fuck outta the runners 'til they're basically dog piled.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Catchin' the ball doesn't get anyone out either.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"E84343","n":"Shigemi","m":": Sometimes we play it so that the batter can keep holdin' the bat until they're safe the first time, just so they have a higher chance of makin' it to a base before they're tackled.","d":"Mar 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Adrian","m":": pfffff","d":"Mar 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"800080","n":"Adrian","m":": true but we'd need other people to play it right","d":"Mar 2016"}
