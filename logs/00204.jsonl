{"t":"a","c":"008000","n":"Calanthe","m":": I don't know why I wouldn't.  It was a perfectly reasonable thing to ask, and I understand the desire to make sure that those you care about are safe even if you aren't there for them anymore","d":"May 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"008000","n":"Calanthe","m":": How do you feel about being a reaper?","d":"May 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Hiromi","m":": I hate it.","d":"May 2015"}
