{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": SOme of them might take your cigarettes because they just don't want you smoking.","d":"Feb 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": One that needs workers to function.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Also, reapers don't get second chances.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": We're stuck in this state.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It does a number on the psyche.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":"<span style=\"color:#FF7AC1;\"> grins wryly. \"Honestly, it's the ones like you that worry me most.\"</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Those 'good' people often change.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Dying does that to you.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Having to kill players to survive does that to you.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> grimmaces.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":"<span style=\"color:#353839;\"> the confusion and weight of those words makes her pause, least enough to silently muse on it for a minute or so.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": Uh, do you mind if I listen to this explanation?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": There are two types of 'worker' reapers.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Ah-! Hey there!","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I honestly thought you were. Listen in all you like.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Wasn't sure if you were a player or not, since you didn't reply.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Anyways, two types of reapers.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":"<span style=\"color:#353839;\"> waves at Lucas, silently pointing to Noa with a grin.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Sorry. Didn't notice.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": One simply keeps track of what other reapers accomplish, as well as give out challenges.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The others....","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": I guess I wasn't listening all that well.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They must fight players. And they must earase at least one. Or they die.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":"<span style=\"color:#FFA45E;\"> then nods to tomoko</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Some choose to only erase the arrogant. Others choose to erase whoever they don't like.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Erase? Is that like dying? Er, again, that is.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But having to erase people you've met and interracted with ain't easy.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And yeah. Erasure is pretty much your second 'death'.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": No more second chances. You dissappear, along with anything you had on you. Nothing remains of your existance.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So try not to lose, okay? Not pleasant.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Ha...","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": I guess erasure explains a few things...","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But yeah, there's one other important thing I should tell you.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Well... in a way, it's not like it's anything that hasn't happened before, right?","d":"Feb 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Good! You get it!","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> smiles wide!</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": ....True","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So often, I meet players who just panic and flail about. It gets annoying. But you seem like a sensible human being!","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Also, this game? it's a TEAM game.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": I'm panicking! I'm panicking <i>\u200bloads.</i>\u200b I'm just... you know.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Players work in pairs of two.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":"<span style=\"color:#FF7AC1;\"> gives a quavering smile.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": ou know.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Panic AND flail about. Not just panic.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Oh...I had my flailing and panicking...you just didn't see it haha.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Ha.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": In pairs? Can we choose?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yes you can.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": Finding someone else will probably be the hardest thing about this.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Aw, if it were for Noa I'd partner with ya","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It often is.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":"<span style=\"color:#FF7AC1;\"> pokes Tomoko in the ribs gently</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": By the way...Tomoko, was it?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": You're not getting away from me that easy.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": You remember what I said about the more violent reapers, yes?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Yeah- ow. Tomoko.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": The sadistic ones?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Remember how I said they like seeing players break?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":"<span style=\"color:#353839;\"> frowns a bit at all this focusing on herself. \" Yeah?\"</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Do you REALLY think they'll leave a pair of lovebirds alone?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": ... We... can't kill a reaper, can we?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": ... Erase.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Look, one of the advantages of being dead is I guess I don't have to hide anymore...if some of the other 'reapers' are any sign of it.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": I don't think it was ever said that they couldn't be killed.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": No. Well, not normally.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": But if all they want is a challenge and see us fight. We'll fight 'em!","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They CAN be killed. But only on the 6th day onwards.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But it isn't recommended.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Provoking a reaper is a REALLY bad idea.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":"<span style=\"color:#FF7AC1;\"> still looks unconvinced.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Usually,  if they're fighting you head on, their ready to kill you.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Guaranteed.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": You can't just go around punching reapers either. You usually have to get them to accept a fight....or wait for them to FORCE you into one.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": But they can mess with players in other ways?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They can mess with the players in a lot of ways.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Like what?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They WILL mess with the players in a lot of ways.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hmmm.....","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Honestly, there's too many ways for me to remember.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": ...no sense in worrying about it","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Acknowledge it even if you aren't worried.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Ignorance gets you AND your partner killed.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": If we can fight reapers on the 6th day onward, what happens before the 6th day?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": After all, if EITHER member of a team dies, the other dies as well.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Please don't kill me.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Various challenges. Usually determined by a higher up.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": I wasn't plannin' on it, Noa.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Reapers like me and nanami are 'workers' essentially.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Attagirl.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The next level up is officers. They're like....mini-managers?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Just what I expected to find in hell. Middle management.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": There's more than one of them. They regulate basic rules around here.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Next up is conductor. They're more like top management. They regulate the more drastic rules and regulations. And paperwork.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And finally, at the top, the conductor. He's essentially the manager's manager.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": He watches over anything. Tick him off, and you WILL die.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And it WILL be painful.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":"<span style=\"color:#FFA45E;\"> <s>\u200b you mean composer</s></span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": ....So who's the guy I gotta avoid pissin off?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> <s>\u200bNEVER LET ME TYPE WHEN TIRED</s></span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Composer. Sorry.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I'm a little tired from dealing with an idiot today.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Anyways, there is one more level in reaperdom.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It lies under the conductor, but above the officer. But they don't regulate rules or anything.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They pretty much run the game. They set up challenges. They set up major fights.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They are the Game Master.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": So, they can make like, a theme?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": They usually do make a theme.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I remember one of my old district's Game Masters set up an entire game dedicated to a fish theme. Boring, but amusing.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": Do they take suggestions?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Not really.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Anyways, a week usually ends with you fighting them in a sort of 'final boss' battle.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Sounds a bit tacky","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": it is very tacky. But it keeps players motivated when they think of this game of life or death as a simple rpg.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": When we play, will you be involved?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Indeed....preferrably.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Still dealing with some technicalities, such as choosing what reaper type I wish to be. The recording type, or the battling type.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I usually go Harrier though. That's the battle-related type.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": Hey...I have a question","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Ask it then.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": There's nothing stopping us from forming allt he players together to win together, is there?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": I mean, aside from the reapers being jerks.- Some reapers.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": You can only form literal teams of 2, but you can all band together and work together to keep each other motivated....","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But if a reaper picks a group to fight, others can't interfere.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": oh","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": You can be moral support. That's about the extent of it.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": After all, this is a game meant to test each individual. If they were allowed to let a massive group carry them, it wouldn't have much of a point, now would it?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": I think it says a lot about an individual if they're able to convince a group to carry them.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": In pairs, it's easier to spot those who lag behind. And teach them what happens to those who don't pull their weight.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": That sounds good on paper, Noa. Not so good in practice.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":"<span style=\"color:#353839;\"> looks almost hurt at Noa's comment. It...wasn't directed at her was it? No it couldn't have been.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I've seen my fair share of players. I've PUNISHED my fair share of players. I've seen all kinds of trash.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Oh, I'm sorry Tomo. I was just thinking of strategy.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": The more we can get other people to help... well, the fresher we'll be when our turn comes up, y'know?","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Good mindset. But be careful.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": I...","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> smiles.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": don't think that's how it works","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The easiest players to target are the ones who trust in others too much.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":"<span style=\"color:#FF7AC1;\"> smiles back brightly, with a bit of teeth. \"I intend to.\"</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"FFA45E","n":"Lucas","m":": Uh, I don't think a lot of people will help, if they still exist at that point.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I am not a pleasant person when it comes to the weak or spineless. You look like you have a lot of potential....","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So you better make sure you live up to that potential. Metaphorically speaking, of course.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Or else i'll be severely disappointed.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": I don't like this...","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> looks at Tomoko and smiles....a little less pleasantly.</span>","d":"Feb 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"353839","n":"Tomoko","m":": I'm not scared...it just feels...wrong!","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": It'll be okay. We'll make it through.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The other just seems a little shooken up by the whole thing in general.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"1877D6","n":"Akio","m":": You don't have to pile all the heavy stuff on them as soon as they get here, dude.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Dead people don't get a say in things, Tomoko.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Better they get used to the weight now, before a more sadistic reaper drops it on them midgame.","d":"Feb 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"FF7AC1","n":"Noa","m":": Yeesh, no need to kick her when she's down. It's a lot to take in. I'm kind of freaking out here too.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": No, but that's all the more reason to let them get used to the weight with that time.","d":"Feb 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Besides, they'll meet other players soon enough. They can relax with them.","d":"Feb 2016"}
