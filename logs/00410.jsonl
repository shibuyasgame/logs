{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... Actually I'm not sure how common is 'strange', I just know that when I've gotten them to talk about stuff, they've been bringing that up way more than in other districts.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Anyway, I mean, it's not like, overly serious in the RG? Just kinda, worsening what people's problems already were. I don't know if helping them out will help the UG at all, but... might as well try.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": You may know this, but the UG and its inhabitants-- things like trends, well being, and etcetera-- is somewhat connected to the Composer at the time.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Since-- Jean came into this position in the worst conditions, his poor wellbeing affected the RGers' mental health as well.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Not so much directly towards the district but-- it'll make Jean's job easier and curb the stress a bit more.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Uuuhhh. Juste mostly did that wall... he was blaming himself and saying he couldn't protect anyone, or something like that. And super worried about Kaito? Who was somewhere else?","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... Yeah, I think that's, like, my only memory of him.","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": So- this 's all from stuff 've gathered talking to 'im and people who know him.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Basically, he started off as a Reaper in Kawasaki, a dump district.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... Wait, that's where Haruki and Nagito are from, isn't it?","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Yeah.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":"<span style=\"color:#BC8F8F;\"> is starting to think this <i>\u200bentire district</i>\u200b needs to learn to talk about their problems</span>","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": The games are big there and you're pretty much forced to be super ruthless and cruel, otherwise you won't be able to emotionally handle the erasure requirement.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": So. Naturally, a lotta people break.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Yeaaah... I got that from those two.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Jean did. From what I've gathered, he had to force his emotions down and suppress them completely- to become a cruel and pretty shitty person. Perfect for Kawasaki!","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":"<span style=\"color:#D91A79;\"> nod nod</span>","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": He moved to Shibuya and started to rehabilitate and got better- but all that, plus everything he's gone through here gave him a fun little thing called PTSD.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": I dunno how it happens in other cases, but I do know that when his brain thinks that having emotions is too stressful and painful for him, it shuts them down and he goes right back to his Kawasaki self.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": And tha's... basically what happened over the past few days.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": As far as I can tell, the stress of losing Kei who I'm sure he was very close with-- and having to support his two daughters and all his friends--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Plus, he had a bad fight with a close friend too-","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": He just shut down.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": I managed to get everyone to snap him out of it, so he'll... most likely be able to be more conscious of his emotions and opening up to people, accepting help--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": But immediately afterwards, something else happened to make him shut down in a different way.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":"<span style=\"color:#D91A79;\"> tAKES A deEP breath thats a lotta talking</span>","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": So-- from what I gathered from talking to Chris--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Takumi attempted to approach Jean and told him about seeing you--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": ...But their phrasing was just off in ways where it would set Jean off.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": They mentioned that you were an Angel and that you were concerned about the district and therefore wanted to help--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... so <i>\u200bthat's</i>\u200b why they've been a bloody wreck for the past day. Moreso than they already were.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": ...Yeah. Probably.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": ...Their wording ended up with Jean stressed and feel guilty that the district being not well is his fault.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": ...Probably, anyway.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Chris said he asked something peculiar, uhm. \"Is she going to fix my brain\"--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": And he was terrified, apparently--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Yeah, they said he was terrified of me for some reason.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Yeah... For good reason, in my opinion--","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": I think when he asked that, he meant it in... a \"physical\" fixing.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": Like, delving into his static to do shit to his brain to fix him.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"D91A79","n":"Usa","m":": So I think that unfortunately, due to Takumi's delivery-- Jean thinks that you're an Angel that's going to physically pick into his brain to fix him because you're worried about the district and nothing else.","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... Uuuhhh. Wait, wait, <i>\u200bthat's a thing I can do?!</i>\u200b","d":"Oct 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": How would, that, we don't even know how they work entirely and even medications designed to alter brain chemistry have side effects and are kinda guesswork because who knows what'll actually help!","d":"Oct 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Even if I know most of the mechanisms behind PTSD--!","d":"Oct 2016"}
