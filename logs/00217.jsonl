(The other two songs being Natsuiro Egao de 1,2 Jump and Mermaid Festa Vol. 1 [my vote Orz] )  First of all, I would like to thank \u5983\u82fa\u3055\u3093 for covering as Honoka for us! \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u266a  Renna tackled the video for this one (THANK YOU RENNA!), and the super speedy timers Noki + Zoey + Renna [again] are always wonderful! Kappa and I had a [not so] wonderful rush while trying to translate this song, but hopefully it makes sense.   Kappa fought with her audio mixing program forever, then another 6 hours of crashing for this so lets all give her a hand too!   *claps*\n\nEveryone sounds wonderful ;w; I wish to never do a Kotori center song ever again~ [I  didn\u2019t even vote for it Orz] TYVM. Doesn\u2019t help that I recorded with a cold (tip from Renna: record earlier) Orz Orz Orz    On that note, My favorite part is when everyone does their fast solos + the part where it goes from Solo to Duets!
