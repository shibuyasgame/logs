{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Marseille isn't bad, actually... just boring.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"1877D6","n":"Akio","m":": I would take boring, honestly.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Mostly because most of the Players come into the game having lived full Catholic lives and think the UG is heaven and don't want to play because they accepted their death.","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"9a0000","n":"Nue","m":": Generally, most people aged 13-19 have enough Potential to do good for the world.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"9a0000","n":"Nue","m":": There is a chance that they can do something to benefit the soul code of the city they live in, somehow... art, music, activism, change...","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Then theoretically, if a fifty year old person had the Potential to change the world, to reach out to something that they couldn't.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": They could be part of the Reaper's Game?","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"1877D6","n":"Akio","m":": You need winners, but no one wants to play?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"9a0000","n":"Nue","m":": Static, music, soul code... all of it forms each other.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"9a0000","n":"Nue","m":": Everything is made of all three of those things...","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"9a0000","n":"Nue","m":": When a Player gets erased, their soul and their static joins the city.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Question!","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"9a0000","n":"Nue","m":": Mm...?","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": Hey, Genevieve. I know you just want to sit with your daisies but you need to complete your part of the mission! You just need to help beat up some seagulls with your teammates, okay?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": And they say.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Yuji","m":": Would be right to assume I'm here because of my connection to music and not necessarily because I've done good with my life?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"B269AE","n":"Jean","m":": \"But Mr. Goductor Sir! I would rather not hurt the seagulls and I am creating a daisy crown for You!\"","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": You're confusing.

{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Then I'll say, in short, that to be confusing is the opposite of what I want to be. I want myself to be as clearly understood as possible, and for that reason I'll say whatever comes to mind. I ask questions because I'm interested in other people, not because I want to force a strong bond, invade their privacy, or whatever else. Paternalism may or may not be on the dot, though.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Saying whatever comes to mind isn't how you practise clear and efficient communication. So it's not really an effective tactic for being clearly understood, if you confuse people from it...","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": It doesn't give you any chance to refine your thoughts. To actually understand other people and put your words in a way they'll understand.","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": You seem to be confusing my intent for tactic. This is how I speak, this is the only way I know how to speak. To pour whatever I know into a conversation, to transfer my thought one to one.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": You may, indeed, be right that speaking another way would be more efficient.","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": The people that I've spoken to?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": reapers are just as diverse as human beings.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Indeed, that is true.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Some people haven't found solace in the job of a reaper","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Not everyone is happy here. We can't speak for all of them.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Some have gne crazy.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": This, then.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": I got a really good guide on how <i>\u200bnot</i>\u200b to be a harrier by watching the ones I saw...","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Is my last statement on the topic.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": If people are suffering, whoever they may be, shouldn't their suffering be reduced? If there is something that can be done, shouldn't it be done? Shouldn't we aim for, again, as close to perfect as possible? Shouldn't we aim for a better world?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": That is what I, Icarus, believe in.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So tell me this.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": What can be done?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": I have a long list that would be useful, let me see...","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":"<span style=\"color:#F5C814;\"> opens a book, \"And Then There Were None.\"</span>","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": ... Kazuya-san asked Kei-sama to erase him. Kei-sama's letting him replay the Game.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":"<span style=\"color:#F5C814;\"> There are several scribbles on the margins.</span>","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": To start, I believe that personal preference should be excluded from judgement. With the creation of a standard criteria, there may be bias, but that bias will be much reduced. It would reduce the suffering of several Reapers, make their job easier, and allow the Reaper's Game to be more properly controlled.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And right there is where you already have a problem.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": I may or may not be wrong, but that is why you are here.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": If that is wrong, then tell me why.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": First off, as i've already stated, no one can remove personal bias, and even if you try to reduce it, it is there and will just rise back up.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Second, you say REMOVING personally bias would make reapers lives easir?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Wouldn't it hurt more...?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So you want us all to be mindless husks that just murder whoever we're ordered to?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Then allow me to explain.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": You seriously think that'll make us feel better?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": In fact MANY reapers are broken because they're FORCED to hurt players they don't want to kill.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": ... Isn't that Harajuku's Game?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": Sunao-hebi-sama said no mercy when ordered.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": THEN, ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN!","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": IF YOU WANT ME TO TALK, LET ME TALK!","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> blinks. And smiles.</span>","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": As I was saying.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Personal bias, indeed, can't be removed. The reason I'm recommending a standard criteria is to reduce it. Reduction is important, prevention is superior to cure. If it raises, then with that system it could be controlled. You say it would hurt Reapers, that you'd be mindless? No.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": (( will continue, just a sec ))","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": I would never, ever ask you to become mindless, to act without thinking. But if there is a standard criteria, Reapers will be able to focus on that, they'll able to blame it, they'll have something to soothe their soul. As for being forced to hurt people you don't want to hurt, that would be another suggestion I had.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":"<span style=\"color:#A8A8A8;\"> just has. started crying already, trying to keep it silent, definitely keeping Orion between her and the person who is yelling. thirteen years of trauma have made yelling very, very much a terrifying thing.</span>","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": ...Uso, are you alright?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So we should just blame all our problems on a set of rules, rather than ourselves or the players or whoever is actually at fault? Wow! So healthy~","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": No.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": The problem, Orion, is that there is nobody to blame. Guilt is internalized, piled up, stacked until the person is broken. The Reaper's Game, as far as I know, is nobody's fault.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> reassuringly pats Uso's head.</span>","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": It should be nobody's fault.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": No everyone should survive.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": That is true.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": If A player fails one of the criteria, does that not mean they are to blame?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": But I think that even this minor system would improve quality of life.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Then!","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Sorry, but it won't.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Another suggestion, added on top of that.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But i'll just let you continue~","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> laughs</span>","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": If a Reaper believes a Player shouldn't be judged poorly for failing a criteria, they should be able to submit a request handled by a superior. The standard criteria itself would be adjusted based on the needs of the Reapers involved.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": If you don't believe this would be useful, then there is, again, nothing wrong with that.","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So we should shove more work on the man who already faceplants into concrete from stress?","d":"Jul 2016"}
