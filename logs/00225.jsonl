Estelle) [Raw Audio]</span><span style=\"color:#808080;\">YouTube \u00b7 2:56 \u00b7 4M \u00b7 99%</span><span>The song from \"Jailbreak,\" the season one finale.\n\nComposed and written by Rebecca Sugar. Sung by Estelle (Garnet). Arranged by Aivi Tran and Steven \"Surasshu\" Velema. Strings performed by Jeff Ball. Demo put together by storyboarder Jeff Liu. Art by storyboarder Joe Johnston. Steven Universe was created by Rebecca Sugar. Aivi &amp; Surasshu's Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/aivisura/steven-universe-stronger-than-you-feat-estelle\n\nFrom Surasshu:\n\"This definitely qualifies as a career highlight for me! The song was composed by Rebecca Sugar, and an initial demo arrangement was made by Jeff Liu, which Estelle sang over. Estelle is one of my favorite modern R&amp;B singers, so this was a daunting and yet enticing proposition to arrange.\n\nTaking Jeff\u2019s arrangement as a guideline, we really wanted to emphasize the euphoria of Garnet being reformed. Rebecca told us to capture the feeling of \u201cthere\u2019s no way she could lose\u201d. I also felt that the new Garnet design warranted a new Garnet bass sound (for those of you keeping score: where Pearl is piano, Garnet is represented by synthbass), so this was a great opportunity to showcase it. I also felt like the bridge needed a synth solo, so I went all out on this one!\n\nAivi did a fantastic job adding to this arrangement by making the string sections magical (especially at the end when the song turns dramatic) which were then beautifully performed by Jeff Ball. Everybody did such a great job with this song, and I\u2019m extremely proud of the final result.\"</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span>"}
