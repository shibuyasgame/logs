{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Ricard","m":": oh. cool. i'll just listen","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"32CD32","n":"Paige","m":": Gamma and Zeta used to be complete opposites.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Tau","m":": The entire reason he became involved with criminals was because he could not stand to lose. Whenever he faced an opponent that posed a chance of his defeat, he had his connections eliminate them.","d":"May 2014"}

{"t":"a","c":"32CD32","n":"Paige","m":": You know, Gamma helped him cheat so he wouldn't lose.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Ricard","m":": but this seems like a personal conversation.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"32CD32","n":"Paige","m":": I don't know why she stayed with him when he was a jerk to her.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Tau","m":": Yes, she would have done that.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Tau","m":": She felt that it was her responsibility to keep her brother safe.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"32CD32","n":"Paige","m":": It's not really all that personal.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Tau","m":": She hoped that she could curve his morals so that they were straight again. Too much of an optimist, she was.","d":"May 2014"}
{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Tau","m":": So she ended up dying because she followed him and his choices.","d":"May 2014"}
