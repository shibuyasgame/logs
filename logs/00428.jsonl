{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": The goal of the game is to knock the opponents pin off the table by flicking your pin...","d":"Jan 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Now, the issue with this is that it's difficult to knock an oppoents pin of when you're both flicking at the same time.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So you have Whammies to help you out~","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> and here's Orion's bootleg as heck way to translate magical whammies into a real game</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Whammies are little motions you can do to help you get an edge. They are the Stinger, the Sledgehammer, or hammer for short, and the Divebomber, or bomber for short.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"17806D","n":"Suguri","m":"<span style=\"color:#17806D;\"> except this is tin pin slamer so they're whamies, obviously</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"B82525","n":"Satsuki","m":"<span style=\"color:#B82525;\"> thank you</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": To do a stinger, press down on your pin, and keep it firmly in place. This keeps your pin from gettimg knocked off easily and also causes the opponents to rebound more easily.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": To do a hammer, quickly spin your pin in place. This can send other pins off course as they come.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": To do a bomber, you do a tricky little motion to get your pin in the air, then slam it onto, or near, the opponents pin.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Gently, of course.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> grimmaces at the thought of bent pins from playing with Uso.</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> that child will slam the pins into your fingers. Have you ever seen a smol child bend a grown man's finger? Not fun.</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"B82525","n":"Satsuki","m":"<span style=\"color:#B82525;\"> maybe kinda hard tho</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Now then, you may be wondering what will happen if you use whammies against other whammies.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": This turns into a similar situation to rock paper scissors.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hitting a stinger with a hammer, will cause the stinger to get dislodged, and it'll actually be pushed out of the way and quite likely off the table","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Hitting a hammer with a bomber will cause the hammer itself to spin away from the force","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"FF8C00","n":"Jinkx","m":"<span style=\"color:#FF8C00;\"> is blas\u00e9 about this entire experience</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And countering a bomber with a stinger will cause the bomber to reflect off and through the air.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> screw you I have to living people here. I cant go showing them magical hammers and shit.</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> at least I dont think I can.</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> TIN PIN SLAMMER HAS NEVER MADE SENSE OKAY</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"17806D","n":"Suguri","m":": Mm... sounds tricky.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"B82525","n":"Satsuki","m":"<span style=\"color:#B82525;\"> it really hasn't.</span>","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"17806D","n":"Suguri","m":": Does it take a lot of practice?","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So, in other words, Stinger beats Bomber. Bomber beats Hammer. Hammer Beats stinger. Like rock paper scissors.","d":"Jan 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": A little bit. Would you like to try?","d":"Jan 2017"}

I think the gift reflected on you, but if you don't make minimum effort to get them something they like, and it shows, such as buying their favorite lotion but leave it in the bag with price tag on it because you couldn't be bothered to wrap it up since you do not care for it, they can pick up on that. And not only that, makes it feel like you're an afterthought. You should put some care in choosing and prepare the gift for the receiver.","d":"Jan 2017"}
