I strongly advise anyone against practicing the piano on your bed as it will indeed probably do your back in over time. Unless you are playing TSFH music all the time and you have the strength of a thousand men anyway, your whole body literally becomes too epic and utterly invincible so you dont have to worry about anything...think I will leave it there lol.\n\nHope you enjoy\n\nMark :D\n\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/mfpiano\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/mfpiano\nITunes: http://itunes.com/markfowler\nGoogle Play: http://goo.gl/20FO8G\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/6tzfzk\nSheet music store: http://bit.ly/Mark_F_\n\nBooking/Business: \nmwfpiano@gmail.com</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span>"}
