The S. is actually about two character who picked up a library book, written by the author who usually go by S. and they keep trying to find out the author's identity but like, they never actually met each other in person. This book literally look like a library book. and like, they just start checking out the book, write their comments in it, return it, then the other one write their own comments in it and return it and they have so many interesting things included too. like this guy put a newspaper article from their school because he got expelled but was like yolo and still come to the campus library to check it out which is great because otherwise there's no sotry within this actual sotry","d":"Nov 2015"}
