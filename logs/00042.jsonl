Project DIVA F is the first game in the series to be multi-platform, with it being developed simultaneously for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, though there will be some differences with regards to control schemes.</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span>"}

First of all, it would take wayyyy too long especially for the Two-Faced Lovers side. And also, does this really require subbing? No. It's already pure awesome. Besides, I don't want to mess up the amazing picture. ;o;\n\nBut yeesss, I am currently walking on subbing another mashup, so look forward to it! I'm about halfway through it.

Voting time!! Would you like me to upload more Vocaloid mash-ups in the future (other than the one I'm working on subbing)? And if so, do you want me to sub it?\nI only really want to sub the really awesome ones (excluding this video) because subbing takes really long. \uff4d\uff08\uff0e\uff3f\uff0e\uff09\uff4d\n\nOFF-VOCAL MP3 DOWNLOAD:\nNICOSOUND: http://nicosound.anyap.info/sound/sm2...\n\n--\nI DO NOT OWN ANYTHING AT ALL IN THIS VIDEO.
