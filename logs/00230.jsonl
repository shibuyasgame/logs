{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": Tell me anything you want to.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... the first day, I met Luna almost immediately, and she saved my life then. We were singing together when our entry fees were taken. After that, she sang alone, but it was beautiful and... music still <i>\u200bexisted</i>\u200b in the world, so everything would be okay. She was happy. I was happy. Neither of us actually were, but we were magical girls together anyway, and destroyed a police car after she remembered one killing her. She told me about her brother and I told her I'd always protect her. We made a pact within the first few hours and we thought everything would be okay.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": You...destroyed a police car?","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Yep. We found one. And kicked it and beat it up until it broke. Mostly her, 'cause we found out I couldn't use my pins outside of battle.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": That's interesting..","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": Tell me more.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": The second day, Kei-sama came down and talked to us himself, and the Game wasn't fun anymore. Luna was back at Ochre, where we were staying. I didn't have her with me, so it hurt more when Kei-sama described how this game was pitting all of us against each other, how the reapers were our enemies but we were enemies with all the other players too and in the end if we fought it meant our survival was the most important out of everyone's. I realised at least five people had to die. It was... scary. So scary. I'd been smiling since I woke up and Luna had been helping me because she always smiled too, and I thought if I stopped I'd never start again. Jessamyn noticed when I stopped-- when I was crying-- and she came over and hugged me and it felt like I was safe from all of the scary things, because in that moment it felt like everyone but her or Luna wasn't safe to be around, might want me dead. I called her senpai and I loved her. I still do. She promised she'd remember me forever, and... somehow, that made it seem okay, like even if I got erased someone would still <i>\u200bremember.</i>\u200b","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... I told Kei-sama he was wrong. That the game didn't pit every single person against each other, because we had <i>\u200bpartners</i>\u200b and we had to care about them, and he patted me on the head and said I'd unlocked another piece of the puzzle, as long as I didn't just value my partner as the key to my own survival. So I decided that no matter how scared I was or how much I wanted to give up, I had to keep fighting. Not for myself, but for Luna.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":"<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> . . .</span>","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Usa-san provided costumes, later, and Ri-chan led us in a cosplay dance performance of Love Live. I'm not really sure what led up to that. Truth or Dare, I think, but I was off talking to Mai-chan about why she killed herself and if I could still trust her, so only got to the end.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Oh, and then I met a fox Noise! Its name was Peaches! I set it on fire a bunch but it was <i>\u200bso cute!</i>\u200b","d":"Jun 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": Freezing it could have preserved it.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Maybe... but I think dealing ice damage to things erases them too.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I remember seeing a couple ice pins...","d":"Jun 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": The third day, Fire-chan erased Aella-san. Mai-chan had hoped to be a reaper, but Kei-sama said he didn't want her, so Usa-san held her in the middle of a group hug and assured her she'd be part of the city. I didn't know what it meant then, and she was my friend, so I cried again and promised Luna we'd be together forever. We had to keep going, though. Later that day, Iris-san erased Yuuna-san. Shion-san told us we all had to keep going... very encouraging.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": Day four?","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Important things happened on day three, though... I'm getting to them!","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... we had a group hug going and were laughing and cheerful and in the middle of friendship. Then... I sat with a few others and watched helplessly as Iro-chan dragged Sef-san off for a solo battle. They pitted him against a fox Noise, but the fox took on the form of his best friend, a boy who'd died a few years back or disappeared or something. I think, anyway. Sef-san couldn't bring himself to attack the disguised fox, but his psyches activated autonomously to kill it just before he died. Several minutes into Sef-san's fight, Ruki-chan an' Nagi-chan cornered Ri-chan-- Sef-san's partner!-- and asked her if she wanted to play a game. She was really smiley and happy and loved everyone, so of course she did.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I still remember the exact inflection in Ruki-chan's voice when he told her he wanted to break her.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": She didn't break. Sef-san did, he broke, he was practically catatonic, but she never did, even when she was so close to dying.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": She was still smiling as we were watching and begging someone to interfere because even Nagi-chan wanted to stop and it wasn't a clean erasure, it wasn't <i>\u200bright.</i>\u200b Usa-san phased in and took what would've been the fatal blow, then took Ri-chan home.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": On the fourth day, Jess-senpai was sad because no one wanted to take her offer. 'Option D'-- a way to get out of the Game freely, without being erased, becoming a reaper, or... I forget the third possibility.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... Sef-san took her offer.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": She said a player's partner is what binds them to the UG and she couldn't do anything while they were both bound... so while she hated to ask this of them, could he and Ri-chan be dears and erase one of themselves?","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Sef-san dragged Ri-chan into the Noise plane and fought her. He yelled at her and tried to get her to shut up, but... she said games weren't as fun if they couldn't talk... insisted they were best friends...","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": In the end, he couldn't erase her.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": But she never ever realised they weren't just playing, so erased him instead.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": She had seven minutes. She was hugging Jess-senpai and Jess-senpai was promising they'd play together forever, but then all the lights went out and there was screaming and four minutes after Sef-san's erasure the lights came back on and Ri-chan was gone and senpai was sobbing.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... I believed in senpai. That she'd never hurt me or Ri-chan. Anyone else, maybe... but she loved us. I believed that with all my heart.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Others didn't, maybe. I don't know if they did or didn't back then. I wasn't listening. The mission was to hunt down whatever killed Ri-chan and erase it and that's what we did.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... the Noise that killed her looked a lot like senpai's Noise form, but I didn't know it then.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": By the time almost everyone was gone, Iro-chan brought musical equipment out and played an impromptu concert for me and Kafu-san to listen in on and do our best to join in. Afterwards, they said I could borrow a guitar-- the guitar I'm holding, actually-- for the rest of the week, so that I'd still be able to make music, even if I couldn't sing. They called me Sango, the colour of coral, and I told them they must never lose hope no matter what-- 'cause they hadn't been doing really well earlier this week, you see? And hope is such a very, very important thing! We were friends, then, and promised we could text each other if anything was wrong.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": The fifth day we met Airi Koizumi and she told us we were terrible at Reaper Creeper and it was true.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Then she told us about senpai being a yandere and how she'd killed her and Naoki and I didn't want to believe it was true but senpai wouldn't explain otherwise.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":"<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> shudders. Yanderes...</span>","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... as we cleared the walls, Arisu-san an' Myra-san were erased. Kenta-san and Aya-san became reapers.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": I didn't really know them too well... but it was sad, anyway.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Before I could hug Iro-chan, Ruki-chan dragged all the players off into a bonus boss battle with his Noise form. I didn't want to fight. He did. Midway through the fight, he growled out something about not being able to care, and-- he'd cared about Sef-san, an' Ri-chan, an' I knew it because I watched him when I told him the news of their erasure. We set him on fire a lot and he wouldn't tell us if he was going to be erased if we won and I hugged him, then burnt him to death while doing so because I hated him more than I had ever hated anyone and my pin remembered.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": He didn't die, though. It was... okay. He just detransformed and disappeared.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Iro-chan taught me how to play the metal genre while activating pins. It was mostly the pins I needed help with. Ruki-chan asked if he could borrow me, and I said yes, so he threw me into the Noise plane and tried to murder me, except he couldn't, so he broke down and we had a feelings jam instead and now we're friends.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": On the sixth day, Kei-sama threw Nagi-chan into a trash can, and we had the <i>\u200bbest mission ever.</i>\u200b","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Senpai brainwashed four reapers into focussing on nothing but their problems, but also into opening up about them and being willing to talk and whatnot instead of just being stupid tsunderes like Nagi-chan always was.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":"<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> is glad she wasn't there.</span>","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": We had to try to help them and provide counselling and talk them through everything, and the brainwashing was absolutely horrible but at least we got to help, and effectively!","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Nagi-chan was first. He was super easy, because I'd been trying to get through to him all week. Ama-san was second-- Misae-san an' Altair-san handled that. Kafu-san and I helped Cal-san, mostly, then we were all confused about Jean-san until Juste-san started yelling at him.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": Ahh~. Juste~.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":"<span style=\"color:#000080;\"> that's a familiar name that makes her happy.</span>","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": A wild fox Noise drew all of us into battle. There were twelve of us. It took the forms of our dead friends and copied their abilities... and it killed Takashi-san and Sen-san, so Takeshi-san and Tomohito-san were erased as well. It would have killed more of us. Maybe lots more. But... it bounced, and eight of us were left behind.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": Noise can bounce?","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Aisu","m":": Disgraceful..","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Apparently! Or wild, semi-sentient Noise can.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": By that point... we were glad it did.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... watching Iro-chan break Sef-san earlier made it easier to hit it, but...","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": It still took out four of us.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... the eight of us remaining knew the GM battle would be the next day. A bunch of us congregated at Ochre and Ji-chan made everyone delicious soup! I was... so scared. I didn't think my pins would work. Not against senpai.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": The seventh day, I woke up early and played music for two hours straight. Luna joined me early on and sang while I screamed and... it was nice. It was peaceful, as much as metal at max volume can be. We almost managed to forget we were scared.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Fire-chan started a bonfire to light up the eternal darkness and we all roasted marshmallows and had a party and were <i>\u200bhappy.</i>\u200b","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... but we had to fight her, in the end, so when the mission mail came up... we travelled there together. Players and reapers and two shopkeepers.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": She said she loved us. She said no one ever understood, and they all tried to leave her, and... and I <i>\u200bhated</i>\u200b her. I was <i>\u200bfurious.</i>\u200b But Luna didn't stop talking. She didn't make it as easy as just setting things on fire, and long ago I'd already decided I'd go along with her today because no matter how much I loved Jess-senpai I loved Luna more.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Luna was why I kept fighting and today she was talking to senpai and trying to help her the way we'd helped everyone else, so I couldn't just... not join in. We tried to convince her she didn't have to do this, that nobody had to die, that Cal-san's GM didn't have to die and everyone in Usa-san's district was just defeated, that we could break free of this web of death and come back and visit and happily ever after and she wasn't talking so much and was pausing more so I thought it'd work, I really did.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ...","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Luna didn't have a healing pin.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": She was poisoned and close to death and I knew it, damn me I <i>\u200bknew it!</i>\u200b I was texting Iro-chan and Fire-chan and... I was scared, so scared, not only for myself but for <i>\u200bher</i>\u200b because <i>\u200bshe was going to die and I knew it and there was nothing I could do!</i>\u200b","d":"Jun 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... we would have all died if we hadn't gotten through to her. Kafu and Asahi were so close to death. Only adrenaline was keeping them going.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Juste and I weren't much better, though he was the best off out of all of us.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": She attacked herself. Over and over again. She just wanted the pain to stop. The loneliness.","d":"Jun 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": ... right before she was erased, as Juste dealt the finishing blow he'd been charging for three turns, she said my name and that she was sorry, and damn it all I still loved her.","d":"Jun 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"BC8F8F","n":"Kashi","m":": Then it was over. The four of us collapsed, pretty much right where we were, and Usa and the others convinced us to come back out to everyone who had been screaming and cheering support.","d":"Jun 2015"}
