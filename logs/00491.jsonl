{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Orion","m":": Also, all reapers HAVE to take care of players! They don't get to pick the pairs they take care of, but still. You get to raise a pair or two into powerful warriors. Another thing I think you'd enjoy.","d":"May 9"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Uso","m":": That's okay!","d":"May 9"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Orion","m":": Lastly, Fuwa's game is a WAR game. So it's one very large team against another.","d":"May 9"}
