This is going to include remixes of most of the songs from the first 2 soundtracks (like how Future remixed the first game's songs) and hopefully some original tracks (which will be MUCH harder).\n \nAs for this song, I only came across it recently which kind of reinspired me to work on this project. It's from the game Ollie King, and was a pretty wicked remix if I could say so myself. The Ollie King OST also had a remix of The Concept of Love, which takes care of another track for what I'm working on (since these 2 remixes are so bomb already).\n \nBut yea, this is just a very long WIP. I'm closest to actually putting together the remix for the song \"Let Mom Sleep\", but I wouldn't expect anything for awhile since finals are around the corner and summer seems like it will just be work and school -_-.  As for the name \"Jet Set Radio After\", that's just what I've called it for the longest time since it would be....After....JSRFuture o.o. But I've grown to think of that name as official xD.\n\nSo all I can say is enjoy this track and expect something hopefully similar (and original) from my own hands...and hopefully soon $_$\n\nConcept art by Corey Lewis</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span>"}
