{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": Dopamine is a chemical released by your brain when you perform a pleasurable act. Evolutionarily, it exists in animals, and is released when they eat, accomplish tasks, or performe intercourse. The chemical is released because if they took no pleasure from completing these tasks, they would feel no reason to do so, and would not be able to survive, ergo natural selection. Today, technology has advanced to a point where many things people enjoy are readily availabe through internet games and other easily accomplished tasks, so by performing these tasks in excess, you  can cause a dopamine irregulation in your brian, which makes you more prone to addiction and decreased cognitive ability.","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"A8A8A8","n":"Retro","m":": That is for a number of reasons. Dopamine isn't necessarily released from using phones too often. It depends what the device is used for. If you use your devices for research or common communication, you most likely won't receive an excess of dopamine. But if you play phone games all the time, you are more likely to develop a dopamine addiction. There are specific games that cater to this system to sell more. They are most often the \"freemium\" games that cost nothing to download, but coerce those with addictive tendencies to spend more on micropayments. This enables dopamine release and regulates it in a way that causes them to constantly pay more for a bigger release in dopamine. This is a prime cause of dopamine addiction in society.","d":"Feb 2015"}
