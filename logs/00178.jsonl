{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": I figured as much xD","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"1877D6","n":"Kaito","m":": Defense can be helpful!","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"1877D6","n":"Kaito","m":": Though it can also be pointless.. if your enemry nullifies it","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"1877D6","n":"Kaito","m":": Bunnieesss","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Yup. I didn't see much of that so far, but it is never a bad idea to be cautious xD","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": That'll hopefully change tomor...hm?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": What?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Ah, thought you were calling me.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": I was just saying hello.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":"<span style=\"color:#CCAA21;\"> more or less</span>","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Ah~ Well, once again, Hello~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": It's so boring around here with only two people...","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": You would think that more people would be here... But I don't know of a lot of cases of people dying in Shibuya.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": I think that people are just preparing ~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": ((I'm hoping there's a day 00...)","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": ((There usually isn't-- Hopefully more people will be on tomorrow though ))","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": But what is there to prepare?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": They must scope out the area of course. Make sure that everything is where they remember it here in shibuya.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Some of them also need to mentally prepare. Tis quite a task to be shoved into a game of death~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Hm, I guess.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Personally, it is nothing new for me, so i've just been spending my time relaxing~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": I spent too much of my life doing that.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Hmhmhm~ You can never relax too much. When you do, it stops being relaxation~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": I didn't really \"relax\". I was cooped up in my room rather than going outside.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": But that was my own choice, I didn't want to go out of my comfort zone.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Ah. I suppose I know that feeling. I never really wished to go too far away from home. Now look at me~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": I may be a tall glass of water, but nothing much else. No hidden flavor or secret vitamins~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": But in the end, what is truly better? To live life the way that you desire, or to live a facade the world forces upon you to succeed?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": I still have yet to decide that for myself....","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Live the way that makes you happy.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": That's the obvious answer, but in some cases it's not achievable.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Indeed. Now if only it were that easy, haha!","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": But I digress, how goes the world-ending alpaca quest?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": I got annoyed after a while, staring at the screen, doing the same thing over and over again.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": That's the unfortunate thing about most games, they're too repetitive.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Yeah, that tends to happen~ you do realize that you don't need to have the game on for alpacas to appear, yes?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": but yeah, that is why I play RPGs. No matter how many times I play, I can always find a better way to do it~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": I did realize that, but it's still repetitive.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": I like to find short indie games.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Mainstream games are boring.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": shovel knight tickle your fancy?","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":"<span style=\"color:#CCAA21;\"> shrugs, \"Haven't played it much. I died before I got to do anything.\"</span>","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Ah.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": For a good year or two I stopped playing games so I could move.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Well, i'm used to playing more hellish games. even if I must die a dozen times to learn how to do something, it makes it all that much more rewarding~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Tried to meet new people but it didn't turn out great, so I went back to gaming.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": Ah....well then, I suppose this'll be a second chance at THAT as well~","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"CCAA21","n":"Garth","m":": Yep.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Hozen","m":": And i'll be certain to help if I can. In return...do try to help me excercise a bit more, ehehe....","d":"Feb 2015"}
