{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Runa","m":": A Reaper could choose to become your Partner, if they are not immediately erased for their betrayal; the Composer could offer you Reaperhood, although he has not done so yet and I do not see why he would start; your Soul Code can be recreated into another object, but that requires an especially powerful Reaper to do so; or if you survive the Game after your Partner's death.","d":"Feb 2017"}
