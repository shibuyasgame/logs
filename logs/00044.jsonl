So, this is the series I've been recording for in the last little bit. :) My main character is Suiko, who is a member of \"Team Ultra-Rare\", which happens to be a pop group in the series. She's the more level-headed of the group, and acts sort of like their \"bigger sister\". She doesn't appear much in the first few episodes, but starts to appear more and more throughout the series.\n\nIt's really fun voicing her, as she's always calm which is kind of the opposite of many characters I've played up until now.\n\nThe rest of the cast is as follows:\n\nAichi: James Beach\nKourin: Stevie Forzani\nMorikawa: Lucas Gilbertson\nRekka: Michelle Molineux\n\nDon't forget to check out the rest of the series: http://www.youtube.com/cardfightvanguard</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span> BLUE HAIRED LADY"}
