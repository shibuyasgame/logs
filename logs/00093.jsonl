They are foursome out of a dozen of raccoon families that stopped by to steal a few nibbles of the cat food we \"used to leave\" out for the area stray cats.  They were cautious, but curious to come close enough for the camera to capture their behaviours and vocalizations.\n\nWe are fortunate to be able to observe a variety of wildlife since we reside next to a protected wildlife preserve where raccoons are one of the many animals consider it home. We hope you will also enjoy watching this video of the close encounter of our charming furry friends.\n\nPlease note these are NOT our pets thus please follow your local wildlife guidelines for the safety of humans and animal wildlife alike. Additionally, we live in a region where there hasn't been a case of raccoon rabies for over 25 years according to the state's public health website documentation. \n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nHave you found an orphaned, injured raccoon or is a family of raccoons living inside your home, here are some helpful guidelines in what to do: \n\nIf you have a raccoon family living in your attic, walls or any part of your home, please contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator for assistance in how to best remove the family and the methods to secure your home so they cannot return. If you've found an adult raccoon that has been hit by a car, check to see if it's nursing female;  the babies will cry for their mother once they become hungry so check back daily and listen for their cries. Please contact your local licensed wildlife rehabilitator for assistance in how to capture and safely transport the kits ASAP.  \n\nRaccoons are orphaned for a variety of reasons, the vast majority of which are caused by humans.\u00a0When their mothers are killed, babies will often remain in the den for up to two days waiting for their mothers to return.\u00a0Eventually they\u00a0become so desperate that they will plunge from trees.\u00a0 Small raccoons\u00a0that are found on the\u00a0ground crying usually need to be rescued\u00a0and care should be taken to look for siblings.\u00a0 Raccoons are very good mothers and generally keep a close eye on their young.\u00a0 \n\nIf you find an orphaned raccoon, it is very important to contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator as soon as possible.\u00a0 There is nothing cuter than a baby raccoon, and it is very tempting to want to try and raise it.\u00a0 However, there are many factors that must be taken into consideration.\u00a0 Since it is illegal to keep a raccoon, it is impossible to find a veterinarian who is willing to work on wildlife.\u00a0 In many regions, a baby raccoon cannot legally be taken from the wild and kept as a pet.\u00a0\u00a0 They may be cute and cuddly when they are little, but they become destructive and aggressive when they become adults.\u00a0 It is very hard to rehabilitate an adult raccoon that has lived its entire life in the company of humans with no exposure to its own kind.\u00a0 Often, the \"owner\" will simply let the raccoon go when the situation gets tough. This is nothing more than a cruel death sentence since the\u00a0animal lacks the skills necessary to survive in the wild.\n\nIt also must be stressed that the orphan must be rehydrated before any type of formula is given.\u00a0\u00a0 It can be very tempting to feed a hungry baby, but it can do more harm than good.\u00a0 The baby must first be given fluids before formula can slowly be introduced.\u00a0 Also, you never want to give any wild animal cow's milk.\u00a0 They can not properly digest it, and it can lead to further dehydration and even death.\u00a0 A milk replacer is used that is specifically formulated for orphan raccoons.\n\nIn the rehabilitation setting, raccoons are raised in groups so that they can learn how to interact with other coons.\u00a0 Their caregivers are limited, and they typically are scared of most humans.\u00a0\u00a0Rehabbers do not allow other\u00a0people to pet or play with them.\u00a0 They get the best veterinary care and are released onto protected land.\u00a0 Rehabilitators are trained to meet the nutritional, medical, and housing needs of wildlife.\u00a0 \n\nAdditional note:   I'm very well aware of the dangers of interacting with wild animals since I professionally work with a variety of dangerous wild species.   No children nor pets are ever harmed, especially the wild animals captured in these videos.  \n\n\u00a9 2011 Rio Fun Entertainment\nAll Rights Reserved\nCamera: Canon S95</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span> chitter chitter chitter"}
