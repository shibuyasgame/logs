At their YouTube channel and website!  They even share their own sheet music on their website.  They are the coolest.\n\nI discovered this song from the Deemo 1.4 Update.  This song in particular, really struck me as a beautiful song.  It's meaning is really sweet.  And the vocals, from a well known utaite and vocalist for the group Mili, momocashew, make it absolutely gorgeous.  So i hope you enjoy playing this piece as much as I loved listening to and arranging this.\n\nhttp://projectmili.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ProjectMili\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/momocashew\n\n_________________________________\nSheet Music Download: https://www.mediafire.com/?br9358tory9caei</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span>"}
