{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": In that district, the entry fee was an aspect of ourselves that we had worked on. So whether it is someone's social skills, or assertiveness, it... was designed to make some of us give up.","d":"Feb 2015"}
{"t":"a","c":"9F61E8","n":"Jean","m":": My entry fee was my self control.","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"KoiKoi","m":": Kaito was the first Reaper I met. I still think that in the end, Players carry higher worth than Reapers because of that.","d":"Feb 2015"}

{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"KoiKoi","m":": And we rejected that!","d":"Feb 2015"}
