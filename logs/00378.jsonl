You can check that out here:\nhttp://jvnp.blog60.fc2.com/blog-entry-68.html\n\nA revision of my older version posted back in May.  I heard this version (Katohori Mix) while doing a search for Rin Kagamine videos.  I instantly fell in love with it, but for the life of me couldn't find an off vocal file for it.\n\nThankfully, my twitter followers &amp; motokokusanagi came through with flying colors.   I asked if anyone could find it for me.  All of you took the time to track down his blog, twitter information, nico profile, etc.  And in the end, after a request from the mixer- I found the track that I wanted!  Thank you for your kind efforts on my behalf!\n\nI think this is far superior to the version I posted back in May 2009, but I'll be keeping the original video up regardless as a lot of my subscribers still enjoy it and listen to it.\n\n-----\n\nFollow me for the good stuff!\nhttp://twitter.com/rockleetist\nhttp://rockleetist.blogspot.com</span></span><img class=\"X9155\" onclick=\"X6437(this,event,false);\" src=\"/elements/icon16/inline/close.png\" title=\"Click to hide video thumbnail\"/></span> ))"}
