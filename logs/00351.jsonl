{"t":"a","c":"D47406","n":"Yumeno","m":": ?","d":"Jul 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"575757","n":"Yuji","m":": From what I was told. Certain pins have certain qualities to them. Not everything you think may be compatible with it...or something. If a pin has a fireball quality. Imagine a fireball in some shape or way.","d":"Jul 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"F5C814","n":"Shinken","m":": Hadou is the concept that your energy can be projected. Your energy can surround your body to defend you, or be thrown as a fireball. Hadou can be pure or impure, pure Hadou being easier to control and impure Hadou being more violent and powerful.
