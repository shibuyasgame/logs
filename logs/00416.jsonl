{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I decided after last game that I'll probably become a support.","d":"Nov 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But I'm also thinking of maybe manning the shop during the game.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": A support? You were, a harrier last game?","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yup.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": However, I found myself preferring to watch players from the sidelines, judging their growth and the like.","d":"Nov 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": In Odaiba, I took a very...<i>\u200bviolent</i>\u200b approach, since I believed I was the only reaper capable of properly challenging the players.","d":"Nov 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Well, worthy by my standards.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I knwo you have a lot higher of a bar set for players.","d":"Nov 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But for me, I feel like I can't set it too high, since the reaper's game is so small scale.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": There's only so much people can show within a week in a single city.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So I look for the potential to grow. And to change the people around them.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": And above all else, I look for people who show that they'll actually make <i>\u200buse</i>\u200b of their second chance, and not just repeat past mistakes.","d":"Nov 2016"}

{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Well...That's not entirely true.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": Right, Shibuya let players run around before Games.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": My judgements during the game are reserved for the game alone...but I still judge people's worth even after the game.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Before and after, I suppose.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I watch certain players after they've won, to see what they do with their lives....Well, existances. considering most of the winners last game became reapers.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": .....Afterward?","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":"<span style=\"color:#cd0000;\"> why would you?</span>","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": I see if I was too soft. If they show improvement, it means I'm doing my job right.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": If they squander their second chance, it means I need to up my game.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": It's not like I have anything better to do. I'm dead. And before coming to Shibuya, I was jobless. So I had lots of free time.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Free Time is best spent improving yourself.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": Ah, but does it really matter? What they do with their own second chance is their business. They're strong enough to get through the Game. It's not really a reflection of our abilities unless they were supposed to be erased.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": If it was just about strength, why do we even need a game, though?","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": We could just sick waves of noise at them to see who survives the onslaught.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But instead, we give them moments of repreieve. We give them challenges. We give them a \"game\".","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": .....","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So there is something else we're looking for. Something that isn't so easily measured in one week.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": That's just Shibuya's way of doing things.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Of course, even I don't know what that something is. But finding it has become something of a purpose for me.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": And other districts.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": Not every Game has the same mindset.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Indeed...","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": It's better to just focus on your job, your tasks.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": Let the higher up deal with the judging.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": But that's a rather meaningless existence.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Like a puppet being led around by strings.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> shrugs</span>","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": We're already dead. And we're lucky to be privileged to keep living so to speak.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": We should strive to do our job to the best of our abilities.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": Everything else is just excessive.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":"<span style=\"color:#cd0000;\"> and painful....</span>","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Doing the excessive is what makes this job pleasant for me.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Noone's telling me I CAN'T, after all.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": You're only going to get hurt if things turns out for the worst.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": After all, merely believing you have no other purpose than doing your job..that seems like a much more painful experience to me.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So?","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": So what if I get hurt?","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> raises an eyebrow.</span>","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": It's your choice, I guess.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Indeed. Just as doing your job with no excessive action is yours. And I'll respect that choice.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":"<span style=\"color:#7070CC;\"> laughs a bit sheepishly.</span>","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": Mmmm,","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": Anyway, I wouldn't want to keep you up.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"cd0000","n":"Eliot","m":": I should get going myself.","d":"Nov 2016"}
{"t":"a","c":"7070CC","n":"Orion","m":": Yeah...I've been up for a whole week now. If I wasn't charged up on adrenaline, i'd probably be unconscious right now.","d":"Nov 2016"}
