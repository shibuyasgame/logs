{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Our conductor.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": So, what do you think of Shibuya?","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": It's interesting.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> nods</span>","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": That it definitely is.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": To become conductor, you must show excellent potential as a higher end reaper, and you must then defeat the current conductor in combat.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": I haven't really experienced much though I've been focused mostly on my studies","d":"Jul 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Combat....so I guess singing competition is out.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Bleh. I don't any any experience as reaper.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Nope. Unless your singing rends people's flesh from their bones.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": I haven't even play a game.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": ..................","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": I'm going to get my doctorate in psychology","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": I should practice singing more to see if I can do that.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Metaphorically AND literally, for that matter.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": That sound like a cool ability.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": Which is interesting being a reaper","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": That's really cool!","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Anyways, that's the story of the sad sap. Forever cursed to be a killing machine, a toy for our composer's amusement!","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": I've??? Only been? A reaper a little less than a year? I guess? kinda.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": Yeah, I've been thinking we need to get a system of UG-specific therapists.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Poor sap indeed.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Because that's the fate that awaits all losers in this world. They are fated to be nothing more than playthings for the winners.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": I've only been in two games, and yet.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Will you kill it when composer is bored?","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": That would be a good idea.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Surprised no one killed it yet.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Yup. Or rather, the composer will probably set up the most tragic end possible for them.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": I think it'd help a lot of the ex-players and the reapers.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Tragic end.....partner murder?","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Again, excellent sword user. Anyone who's TRIED to kill them has either been maimed or killed.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": That includes a number of reapers.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": True but still","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": But wow, working towards a doctorate... Makes me feel like I've been wasting time, honestly.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": It really would. I didn't get interested in psychology until after I died","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> has been thinking about taking up some form of online courses</span>","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": ecause if they manage to cut off your means of escape, considering their inability to hold back...","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Hmmm","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": Oh? I'm assuming the Game had something to do with it, then...?","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": ....Good bye target.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": Of course.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": I'll like to see them in action out of curiousity.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Anyways, that person's name is Yoshitsune.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Or rather, that's what people have started calling them.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Yoshitune.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Fitting considering how our district gives titles to people based on their merits.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": It makes sense.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Yoshitsune's merit is being a tragic sad sap!","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": It leaves all of us messed up.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": Even when it doesn't even directly affect us.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> that's not bitterness in his voice Nope</span>","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": How unfortunate.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": I want strawberries now.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":"<span style=\"color:#12A347;\"> and to be carried.</span>","d":"Jul 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": That's honestl not the worst of it though...but I suppose some snacks would be nice.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": Well, I went through the Orlando district and somehow I ended up mostly unscathed. Well, except the fact I can't look at Didney characters the same way ever again.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Taboo Sweets have some strawberries.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": What's the worst though?","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": I can't imagine what that's like.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": Think about it. At this point, there's no way for Yoshitsune to be killed in battle, and being on the losing side just results in replaying. So what's the only option left to them?","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":": Though my Game here was supposedly better than most.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": Hmm...","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": Would you like to talk about your experience?","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": I've been told I'm a good listener.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Kill everyone. And keep suffering until nothing is left of them. At all.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> shakes his head</span>","d":"Jul 2017"}

{"t":"a","c":"000080","n":"Houston","m":": Alright.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": A fair idea, but there is another option.","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": They can win!","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"6127D6","n":"Sol","m":"<span style=\"color:#6127D6;\"> about half that game was him angsting over his dead sister and being gay so he's just gonna Not open up to this stranger yet</span>","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"476655","n":"Erika","m":": If by some chance they can win a game, they'll be free!","d":"Jul 2017"}
{"t":"a","c":"12A347","n":"Meira","m":": Even if they win, they lost their identities, their mercy.","d":"Jul 2017"}
